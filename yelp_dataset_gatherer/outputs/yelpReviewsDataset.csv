Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,We have been here a few times when we make our way to Birmingham. It is literally the best BBQ I've ever had. Can't wait to come back! Also love the pulled chicken sandwich and the bbq chicken thighs!
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,4,"Was on a road trip and saw this on Yelp so decided to give it a try. The potato salad was solid...  the kind I like with a bit of tang but not sweet. The bbq pork sandwich was the best thing we ordered. The pork is super tender and chopped into nice bits. We got it with the white sauce which we liked. My daughter had the loaded baked potato which she said was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. We also got the fried pickles. Those LOOKED better than they tasted but I acknowledge that it was probably because we did take out instead of dine in. I better they are great hot. Overall the sandwich made it a worthwhile stop!"
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"Amazing spot! Wayman was so hospitable and educating about the menu. Pulled pork on cheese grits and collard greens - PHENOMENAL. Also had a mix of fried green tomatoes and pickles, both of which were unwise. Light batter, perfect crisp.Don't skimp on the banana pudding!!"
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"Oh my goodness!!!! Absolutely my number one, top spot for a pulled pork sandwich!!!!!! Wish they had a location out of state. Moist, flavorful and perfect!"
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,4,"Great hole in the wall southern comfort food. I tried fried green tomatoes and they are the best! I can't find any that are just like it! There's a whole wall written of the menu. You can get brisket, pulled whatever, beans, Mac and cheese EVERYTHING! your order at the counter and they call you when it's ready. There aren't many places to sit, but that's ok, you can sit outside and enjoy Birmingham weather. This is not that expensive, down home and delicious. I loved this meal!"
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,4,"Very good but not the best I've had in Birmingham. Got to try the pulled pork sandwich, fried green tomatoes, and cheesy grits. The fried green tomatoes were excellent, but I've only ever had them twice in my life, so it's hard for me to compare. The sauce paired really well with the tomatoes.The meat in the sandwich was cooked perfectly. Tender and juicy. The flavor could've been dialed up a notch though.I thought the grits were good, but they were a bit runny and watery. Overall, it was a delicious meal, but if I'm in Birmingham for just a few days, Mo's and Jim and Nick's would be higher on my priority list."
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"OMG! Lol the hype over Chick-Fil-A... Popeyes.. Stops here. One of the best Chicken sandwiches I've had hands down! I had the fried Green tomatoes as a side, and my lady had the fried pickles as a side (both had upcharges, come with fries standard) Everything was amazing. The Sweet Tea Chicken sandwiches are fried perfectly with a breading that is enough but not thick at all. The white bbq sauce they put on top was delectable. The flavor was unmatched! The pickles were definitely the better side but the Green tomatoes left little to be desired as well! Also they both had their own special sauces! I also decided to put a little of their house bbq sauce on the side to dip my sandwich. Everything was 5 stars easily. Left nothing to be desired, and I actually ate the rest of my ladies food because she was full! 5/5 The only thing that could be better about this restaurant is a better set up ( people in line constantly knocked into us and our table making it quite uncomfortable. ) The location of the counter is really weird, and the seating is extremely limited. Nevertheless, the food made it all worth it definitely. I'd also suggest them to add some type of house made lemonade instead of the standard fountain drinks."
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,4,"Saw's soul kitchen , a phenomenal hole in the wall in Avondale! I had  been to Saw's on several occasions , but just never took the time to review those previous  experiences.  The food is always , always prepared to order and delicious. This review isn't  5 stars ONLY because sometimes the customer service experience has been spotty with the rude cashier lady.  On this last visit, she was not there! Maybe she got fired or found something that doesn't involve dealing  with servicing the public . Let's be honest, it's not for everyone! Fast forward to my visit on 8/15/19.  The lady who took my order was very engaged, she asked me probing questions like , ""how hungry are you?"" This helped me to decide what to order .  She even talked to us about the paid  parking lot and ensured us that our car wouldn't get towed due to the machine not working.  Anyway, I digress- - I primarily went for their whole fried okra , which is so pretty and almost too pretty to eat BUT I ate it with a smile ... a very BIG one!!! I mean , this okra is fried golden brown and so tasty!!  I also had a pork sandwich but the real MVP  here was the okra!  She rang me up A la Carte to save me few cents .  Much appreciated! Great food and atmosphere!!! I'll be back for more okra before their out of season!!"
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"Wow wow wow. Some of the best barbecue I've had in ages. The pulled pork is incredible, fried pickles are AMAZING (especially with the spicy dipping sauce), and the deviled eggs are solid, too.Lots of friends have raves about the wings, so I'm adding that to my list for next time.I came around 2pm on a Friday and there were a few people in line, but we ordered and got our food in probably 15 minutes so not too bad of a wait.The restaurant is small, maybe 8 tables inside, but there are a few outside tables as well. You can also get your food to-go and take it over to Avondale Brewing next door.Love this place and can't wait to go back!"
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"We have been coming to Saw's for years when we're in town and I think I have never reviewed it before because I'm usually in the happiest food coma after we leave! One, their location is awesomely, conveniently located next to Avondale Brewery, which allows you to bring food in to enjoy with your (various) beers! There is usually always a line when we are here and we've been here at least 10 times. I don't mind the wait, it really just supports how how busy this amazing-hole-in-the-wall-best-bbq-ever place always is!I usually am set on my go-to pulled pork sandwich but I recently just tried the smoked chicken sandwich, and both were equally fantastic. The pulled pork is always cooked to perfection and I love the tangy sauce on top. The smoked chicken sandwich was so moist, served extra hot and the white bbq sauce was such a great compliment. I got extra sauce, obviously, and extra pickles because that's how I roll. I got the potato salad on the side which was creamy and tasted homemade. I jacked a few fries off my husband's plate too because they were staring at me...not my fault... staring is rude. Five stars all the way! Saw's, open a location in Illinois and we'll be your number one customers!!"
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"I finally was able to clear out this bookmark. I have had this place bookmarked for years and every opportunity on my trips back to Birmingham, it seems something always got in my way of Saw's barbecue. All of the pictures and reviews always looked so good. Lunch with my mother seemed like the perfect way to check this one off of my list.Saw's puts the hole in hole in the wall. With only a handful of tables inside and a few picnic tables out front on the sidewalk, it's imperative that you come at an opportune time, or you will be ordering to-go. We came for a weekday lunch on a Monday. Although it was busy and we had to get seats outside, I believe it would be much busier later on in the week. It's order at the counter and they bring it to you. Perfectly simple. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich, coleslaw, fried green tomatoes, and pork and greens, which is pulled pork with collard greens on a base of cheese grits and topped with fried onions. I had that. Wow! First, the pulled pork is really good here. It's super moist and topped with that thin vinegar-based Alabama mop sauce. Now, admittedly it could've been smokier for my taste. Also, it was missing bark and a smoke ring. Yet, the sauce and juiciness actually made up for those absences. The fried green tomatoes were fried properly and accompanied with a tasty sauce. Thumbs up. The coleslaw was the vinegar variety and not the sweet Southern kind. It was tasty and you could tell it was homemade. Now, to the best part: my pork and greens. They were exceptional! That dish is about as Southern as you can get. With a bed of cheesy grits and some of the best collards that I've had, I would've been happy with just those two. Yet, they went all extra and topped those with pulled pork and fried onions. The grits were perfect. The greens had a ton of vinegary flavor. The pulled pork was a huge portion, and the fried onions just set it off. It is most definitely a dish that can be shared, and I brought half of it home. They have fountain Coke products and tea. I had a sweet tea that was perfect enough not to insult Southern taste buds. The service at the counter was friendly. Our food came out fast. The prices aren't cheap for the type of fare, but the quality and quantity most assuredly justified the bill. The only negative is the size of the place, but it actually added to the dive charm for me. Since they have other locations, I think I will try another one that is bigger, and next time I'm getting either the sweet tea chicken or the smoked wings with Alabama white sauce. Looking forward to it."
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"I have been coming to Saw's for years yet this is my first review. Most recently I stopped by and got our usual: Chicken & Greens and Sweet Tea Fried Chicken Sandwich. I get these 2 dishes every single time although I'm sure the other menu items are great. I use to get Pork & Greens many years ago and it was delicious as well. The only reason I stopped was because of a diet change. The pork was always so tender and juicy. At times, the chicken can be a bit dry. The combination of the cheese grits, spicy greens, crispy onion straws, smoked meat, and bbq sauce go together perfectly. The Sweet Tea fried chicken sandwich is so juicy and delicious. It's covered in white bbq sauce. Most of the time the sandwich is huge, although I have been served a small one here and there. Overall, delicious food and I will continue to come here."
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"I never have a bad meal here. They have some of the best sandwiches here and they seem to be underrated by patrons.  I always go for the sweet tea chicken and it always leave me satisfied.  Now when you come here, expect a wait and if you manage to get a seat inside this little quaint restaurant, consider yourself lucky as there's limited seating inside.  Otherwise, you'll be sitting outside.  A lot of people don't know this but they have the coveted nugget ice. If you don't know what that is, it's the soft small pellet ice you see in most hospitals. I know you ice eaters will love that.  They have your usual come products and teas, nothing fancy.  They have napkins, signature BBQ sauce, and other basic condiments along with the extra absorbent blue paper towels to soak up sauce and drippings.  The staff is friendly and hard-working and they make sure you're taken care of.My meal was out in a decent manner as always since everything is cooked/prepared fresh.  My chicken sandwich was moist, crispy, and flavorful.  The fries extra crispy and seasoned with good soft insides.  This visit was great.  No complaints. I'll keep coming back."
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"Lovely little place. Our group of Northern swine were visiting from Boston and needed to satisfy our craving for southern style food. We were not disappointed and everything was amazing. The restaurant itself is a quick food type of place but I was surprised at how friendly and kind all the staff were. We ordered the fried pickles, the shrimp and grits, green fried tomatoes, pork and greens and the chicken sandwich. I felt like the creepy little marshmallow man from ghostbusters when we were done but the gluttony was worth it. Every bite was perfect. Presentation A+ and of course we topped it all off with sweet tea! I'd recommend this place if you're in the area. Definitely worth the stop!"
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,This was one of my favorite meals in Alabama. Food was excellent and very cheap given the quantity and quality of food.The place is kind of a dive establishment so don't go there expecting great ambience you pretty much just order at a counter wait for your food and either sit down there and eat or just take off. We opted to do the former since we had nowhere else to run to.Ended up getting the sampler and the chicken plate. The pork was excellent. Really everything was very good I had no complaints at all but I especially loved the okraThe fried okra was excellent .so were the the chicken.Well we were sitting the line out the door kept growing. That was a sign that these guys know how to cook.The price was very good considering the quantity and quality of food.Parking is on the street.Overall if I was in the area I would definitely come back!
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"I could eat here everyday. Whole fried okra, bbq chicken sandwich, sweet tea fried chicken, pork and greens..... I could go on and on about this menu. Eat here and eat here often!!!"
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,Wound up here after landing in Birmingham. Bit of a hole in the wall but was worth it. First of all the guy at the register was awesome. He was extremely helpful for this first timer and even gave me ideas as to what to do on a Wed night. Had the pork over grits and greens. All was delicious and plenty of food on my plate all for only $14.00. I would love to try it again of I had more time here in Birmingham.
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"I'm not sure when a fried chicken sandwich with some heavenly white sauce poured on it became barbecue, but I am here for it. Saw's Soul Kitchens has all the qualities a perfect barbecue place should....hole in the wall, not fancy, a constant line to order and sit, solid menu without getting too crazy, and lastly, amazing food. We don't go to the Soul Kitchen location as much as I'd like but only because we know it will be crowded and we may not get a seat for a minute, but it is by far my favorite of the Saw's restaurants. I'm a frequent orderer of the fried chicken sandwich, pork and greens, chicken and greens and smoked wings. I am not a wing person at all, but Saws has single handedly turned me into one. I sincerely haven't tried something on the menu I didn't like. If you haven't been to Saws, then get your act together and go now!"
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,4,Like all the saw's it was great. Smaller building so get there early. I had the pulled pork plate with 2 deviled eggs and fry's. Was really great B.B.Q couldn't ask for a better sa
Saw’s Soul Kitchen,5,"Bang for your buck: 9/10Quality: 10/10Service: 10/10Ambiance/Location: 9/10Overall: 10/10We weren't even a little hungry when we showed up to Saw's after a day of eating our way through BHam, but we'd been given the reccommendation for Saw's by our friends at Eating Alabama, so we knew we couldn't pass by this spot. So glad we didn't!We split the Colonel sandwich. It's a sweet tea fried chicken sandwich on a yummy honey style bun with Alabama white sauce, pimento cheese, and some of the best pickles I've ever had. This sandwich was everything. The brine from that sweet tea perfectly offset the vinegary white sauce and the pickles were both sweet and tangy to round it all out. The pimento cheese brought both a creaminess and a spiciness to the mix. Based on this one sandwich, we will absolutely be back to Saws to try their other menu items (and get another Colonel, too!)."
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"I first found Yo' Mama's thanks to the Yelp app.  This was back before the Pandemic so we did dine-in.Tip:  The restaurant is currently open for lunch hours Monday-Friday 10:30am-2:30pm. You can order online for curbside pick-up and take-out. Visit their website to place your order.We were greeting with smiles and warm Southern hospitality when we first arrived.  The venue was completely packed, but they did an excellent job of getting us seated and keeping us informed about the length of the wait before our table was ready.  Everything I've tried here was delicious!  We particularly enjoyed the Chicken plate and the Spanish rice with grits.  I look forward to a return visit when dine-in is once again an option, but for now I'm glad they do curb-side pickup.Highly recommended!"
Yo’ Mama’s,5,The food is absolutely amazing!!! They give A1 customer service! And everything is gluten free!!!!!!!!
Yo’ Mama’s,4,"Finally!!! Yo Mama's has been on my list for quite sometime now. This was not my original place to visit today but because the other place had limited parking, I drove a little further and a light bulb went off to visit here. Now, parking is not the greatest here but I was able to find parking around the corner. There were a few people ahead of me to place orders and others had call in orders, so it took sometime to order. I thought receiving my food would take the same amount of time but as soon as I fixed my Tropical Splash and settled in my seat, my Meal of the Day arrived. I odered the fish minus the jambalaya, add cheese grits with hush puppies. The punch is tangy and delicious! The fish was fried hard like I prefer and seasoned (could have been a little less) but overall pretty good! I also enjoyed my cheese grits, creamy and cheesy.  Oh and there was entertainment with two young guys, Dominique gave us a few tunes while the other guy was on the keyboard. Nice! I will be back for the chicken and waffles!!!"
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"Can you imagine a businessman/chef running into you at an event and they can remember everything about you, your entire dining party, what you ordered and what was said at your previous visits many months ago?  That's the extra about this establishment but what's also outstanding is the amazing food!  The dishes are absolutely delicious.   I would eat here everyday if I lived in the area.   They have a great staff, a clean facility, an owner that is giving her all and insist on wonderful customer service plus reasonable priced amazing food!  What more could you ask for?"
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile but never got around to it. My last visit home I stopped by to try the famous chicken and waffles. I was greeted as soon as I walked to the door, I was able to order right away and my food was ready literally in 5 mins. The food and service were amazing. Can't wait to dine here again."
Yo’ Mama’s,5,the service was amazing and quick...plus my shrimp and grits were delicious. Never disappoints
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"Yo' Mama's was recommended to me by a friend. I currently live in Chicago but I'm from AL so when the opportunity approached to be able to visit Birmingham I knew the exact place where I should go. It was still breakfast time when my mom and I visited so we both ordered the chicken and waffles and shared a side of cheese grits. The chicken and waffles came with whipped cream and strawberry's on top with about 5 or 6 pieces of fried chicken. The meal was amazing, my mom and I raved on about how good the fried chicken was and how soft the waffle was. Yo' Mamas even have their own house syrup that they make from  scratch. I don't know exactly what's in it but I'm thinking maybe brown sugar. The restaurant is small, luckily we found a seat but if we didn't we would have had to sit outside or take it to go. I throughly enojoyed the food and can not wait to go back"
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"I've heard a lot about this gem but never been, i don't know what i was thinking taking so long to go. I loved everything about it when you walk in you're immediately greeted. The menu was was easy to not one of those give you a headache menus lol. I decided on the chicken and waffles because that's what i was craving and it was priced well for the portion size that you receive. It didn't take long and my chicken and waffle were fresh and sooooooooooooo good. The homemade syrup is die for literally i think i died and went to heaven. The chicken was the right crispiness on the outside but not dry in the inside. The waffle was delicious not too thick where i was choking some waffles have been know to do that. From the staff, to the atmosphere, and especially the food I LOVED IT!!"
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"When you go to Yo Mama's, you'll definitely encounter a line because people absolutely LOVE this place. It has such quality food and the workers are so sweet. I always get the chicken and waffles because it's so filling and delicious. The chicken is sseasoned perfectly and always crispy on the outside while still being succulent on the inside. The waffle is amazing, especially with the strawberries and whipped cream. The homemade syrup pulls it all together!! It's just so good  you have to give this place a try if you haven't already!"
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"I've always been dubious of chicken and waffles, and I had lived in the south for a while before I broke down and tried them. Yo Mamas has, hands down, the best chicken and waffles I've ever tried. The chicken is wings flavored and fried to crispy perfection, and the waffles are fluffy and delicious. I didn't actually order this dish, but my friend did and let me try it. I told our waitress how incredible it was, and she snuck me over a chicken wing of my own! They serve it with a sweet sauce that is surprisingly delicious. I asked what was in it and was told it was a secret. It kind of tasted like melted butter mixed with powdered sugar, but maybe better? The rest of our meals were great, the service gracious and efficient, and the prices reasonable. We WILL be back!!!"
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"Simple. Unfussy. Hearty. Well-seasoned. Comforting. Filling. I could think of a thousand adjectives to describe our breakfast this morning. All of them good. I had the salmon croquettes with eggs and cheese grits. Didn't have to touch the salt and pepper. Didn't have to doctor the grits. It was just simple perfection. I also snagged a little bacon. Delicious. The atmosphere is warm but hip. The crowd was relaxed and at ease. It was a perfect Saturday in Birmingham breakfast, and we will be back."
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"I have no idea why I have not tried this place before, as it's only a few blocks from my office.  I've been craving hot wings and the last three places I got them, they were scrawny and pitiful.   I thought I'd give Yo'Mama's a try....and OMG.  The wings were huge!  It came with six, I could only eat two.  To top that off, they were absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend the POE Sauce.  The order was ready quickly and the sweetest lady brought it to my car.I can hardly wait to try the other menu items."
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"Yum yum yum!! How did I not know this wonderful black-owned restaurant existed? Apparently it's been around for 5 years. Nestled in a convenient part of downtown, next door to Urban Standard, this establishment does not disappoint. I went around 9 on a Monday and it wasn't crowded (I hear it can get quite busy). The woman who took our order was so friendly, and practically walked us through the menu. My friend and I both opted for the chicken and pancakes--she got lemon pepper wings and I got regular. The pancakes were phenomenal. They are thick, but no like Popeyes biscuit thick, and they have a scrumptious buttery, crispy outside which was to die for. The lemon pepper wings were the bomb and although the plains were good and crispy, the lemon pepper definitely won hands down in terms of flavor. You must try their special syrup on either the pancakes or waffles. You won't be disappointed!"
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"They are located in the north part of Birmingham. Friendly staff, decent menu, quality food... I am currently enjoying the Catfish and fries. The chicken wings were absolutely amazing! You can tell this place is a mom and pop restaurant with freshly made food and great personality. Sit down have some sweet tea and chat with the people who work there too. This place is family owed and they make you feel like family while you are there, so welcoming."
Yo’ Mama’s,5,The absolute best wings in Birmingham. It was my first time there and it did not disappoint! The coleslaw was great. The staff behind the counter was very helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back!
Yo’ Mama’s,5,At one of my favorite spots again. I'm trying the Kiki poo fruit punch this time. The chicken & waffle with the fruit topping never disappoints. Nice Birmingham gem!
Yo’ Mama’s,5,Super friendly service. Took my three year old granddaughter for Chicken and Waffle. Yum yum!
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"A very nice, informal dinner experience. On the meal, the meals range between $10-$13. The menu includes but is not limited to fried wings, fried shrimp, fish tacos, chicken and waffles, and more. The restaurant environment is warm and welcoming. The fried wings are spectacular: thick, well seasoned, and tasty."
Yo’ Mama’s,5,"I was in town for the day, if you have the time at lunch it is a spot you need to eat at.  I had the meal of the day but everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked delicious.  Don't expect fast food this is made when ordered and worth it."
Yo’ Mama’s,4,"I've been here once before and I had the chicken & waffles which was absolutely amazing!!!! And my fiance' had chicken which he absolutely loved. Today I am trying the French toast with smoked sausage, and he is trying the 2 salmon croquettes with eggs, grits & a biscuit. As usual the food was GREAT....... Highly recommended!!!!!"
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,5,"Automatic is a great space with a good, creative menu. It's been better every single time I've gone back. And, their staff is incredible - they're so kind. I have nothing but praise. I can't wait to go back when they reopen... but I've grabbed takeout a few times and can't complain at all. So good!"
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,5,"Sunday pick-up of fried chicken, grits, greens, rolls and dessert....well, I was reluctant at first, even though every thing sounds so good, so we ordered in advance, had a timed pick-up, I arrived early, they brought it to the car, and it was delicious---every morsel. We had half yesterday and will finish off tonight. And, we appreciate their effort to keep staff engaged, serve the community and offer their exceptionally prepared foods, and encourage others to support them, enjoy great food and tell others. This was exceptional, try it...I bet you say the same!  Thank you"
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,5,"Automatic Seafood and Oysters has dominated the Birmingham food scene recently. I came here twice shortly after they opened and was unimpressed, but they have since improved substantially. This is undeniably one of the best dinner options in Birmingham! Everything was spectacular from the moment we arrived. Each dish had a unique flair and exciting flavors. Raw Oysters (5/5): Their assortment of fresh oysters is very impressive, and we enjoyed all of them. Though oysters are subject to personal preferences, I would recommend the Malpeque. This oyster had a perfect size and salinity. It lacks the overwhelming texture and fishy flavor that turns many away from oysters. My other favorite is the Sweet Jesus. Any of their options are great, depending on what flavors interest you. Pork Belly (5/5): Their Pork Belly appetizer was perfect. It was tender and had great fatty edges. Too often, pork belly is thick, chewy, and lacking in flavor. This was just the opposite. It comes on top of a sweet potato puree that is equally delicious. The flavors of the sweet potato contrast with the fatty/ savory flavor of the pork belly perfectly. This appetizer is great for splitting among two or even three people, but it is good enough to order individually as well!Farm Greens Salad (5/5): This salad was phenomenal. I was expecting a standard green salad, but it proved to be far more. Their simple citrus-based vinaigrette dressing is incredible. Furthermore, the peanuts and goat cheese added an incredible complexity to the salad. This is anything but a standard salad!Yeast Rolls (5/5): It is hard to make a lousy yeast roll, and it is even harder to make one that stands out. Their Yeast Rolls are managed to succeed. As a southerner, I have had the privilege of surveying many rolls over the years, and Automatic's may top the list. Firstly, their dough is so light and fresh that is dissolves in your mouth. Furthermore, the salt and honey butter make this appetizer fit for the dessert menu. With their yeast rolls, you are getting savory, sweet, and salty flavors with each bite. Duck Fat Poached Amberjack (5/5): This was my favorite entree of the evening. Their amberjack is incredibly tender, and the XO butter and dressing add wonderful flavors to the dish. Even the greens that come with it are some of the best I have ever had. I was struggling to pick between this and the Blackened Mahi Mahi, and I am so glad I chose the Amberjack!Redfish on the Half Shell (5/5): This entree was almost as good as the Amberjack. It was just as tender and I loved how they cooked it with half of its shell intact. I think this trapped all the flavors and prevented it from becoming dry. Their bacon pieces added a great touch to this already impressive dish. Simply Roasted Halibut (3/5): This was the least impressive dish of the evening. It wasn't bad, but it lacked the incredible flavors of everything else we ordered. It was a little dry and bland. This entree couldn't compete with the Amberjack or the Redfish. I would recommend trying one of their more exciting options. Brown Sugar Cake (5/5): This is their signature dessert, and I see why. Everything about it was perfect. Their cake was fresh and moist. The banana was seared to perfection. However, it was the brown sugar/ caramel and rum sauce that made this dish irresistible. It was sweet but didn't lose the intensity of the rum flavor. This was one of the best desserts I have had in a long time. Trio of Housemade Ice Cream (4/5): Their ice cream was also good, but it was nothing compared to the Brown Sugar Cake. My favorite flavor was the Matcha, but all three flavors were good. It went very well with the Brown Sugar Cake and it was a perfect size to split between three people. After several mediocre experiences at Automatic over the summer, I can definitely say that they have improved exponentially. This is not just a place for good oysters; their entire menu is divine. Everything from their appetizers to their desserts impressed me. Automatic is a Birmingham treat with a diverse menu that will surely impress anyone!"
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,3,"Came here after hearing about it and driving by it a few times. I ordered the duck fat poached mahi mahi and the fried basmati rice. Both dishes were good, but not great - though they had the potential to be great. The mahi mahi was poached nicely on the outside, but the inside was not warm enough for me. The flavor profile lacked a sweet element - saltiness of the fish, bitterness of greens, and briny-ness of the sauce on top. The fried basmati rice was on the right track, but needed more rich flavor - like saffron milk or lemon.Again, l liked the potential, but not necessarily the execution. Given, a choice, I would opt for the fish I ordered at East West. Nice atmosphere, though."
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,4,"We've been hearing good things about this place for a while now, but we also heard it was very expensive for what you get. When we heard they had a brunch menu, we knew we could give it a shot to impress us without breaking the bank.We came in right as they opened on Saturday. We were seated quickly. Our waiter was nice and recommended some things for us. I wish they had another breakfast cocktail and not just a mimosa. The food came out in a decent time and was very tasty. I had the smoken salmon on the roasted potato hash. It was very tasty, though I might order without the capers next time. Those gave a very sour, briny taste at times.Overall, we were very impressed and look forward to coming back and trying this place out for dinner one night. Especially looking forward to some baked or grilled oysters!"
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,4,"I went for dinner this week. I valeted... it was just easier. They don't have a private park area; street parking is an option but limited at dinner time. So we, party of 2, walked in (no reservation) on a Monday night and seated immediately. The tables are on the smaller side but sufficient. The restaurant area is spacious. I suppose this is considered finer dining and the prices reflect that (average scale) - just a heads up. The entrées ranged between $26 and $32 sides were separate for an additional $5 dollars each. We ordered oysters which were $2.75 each. House wine, $10 per glass. The rainbow trout and tuna were great! Cooked and seasoned perfectly.This was a lovely experience and I'd recommend it for special occasions."
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,4,I have had the opportunity to dine here twice once for dinner and once for brunch. Both times were a success. I really like the layout of the restaurant and how open it is. You especially get this assessment in the day time. It's certainly ahead of its time in terms of decor and feel for the Bham area. Reminds me of somewhere in New York or San Francisco layout wise.  As far as the food is concerned I was impressed with the menu options as well. For my dinner meal I went with their fresh catch option I believe it was swordfish it's been a while and for brunch I had the shrimp and grits. I will say I wish they had already peeled the tails off of the shrimp this makes for inconvenience having to cut the tail off while eating each piece but flavor wise it was good. They have fresh oysters too from wherever has them and a decent drink menu.   Atmosphere is laid back but people dress up too but don't feel pressure. It's casual chic. A great addition to the city I wish it success. With so many options available sometimes great places get lost in the shuffle and struggle if you frequent restaurants as often as i do.
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,4,"This has been a highly anticipated meal for me. And although I know a place like this will get the oysters from wherever they are seasonally good, I usually like to wait until it gets cold outside. Mainly because I hope gulf oysters will be an option. But this year, they are a little scarce. So we were happy getting some James River oysters for the briny taste alone. The biggest problem I had was the price point. I know we aren't THAT close to the coast. But there are other places offering the same oysters for cheaper. But the prices overall are the only thing that I had an issue with this entire meal.Our waiter came on a little strong to start with. But he ended up being extremely helpful as we continued through the meal. As we do so often with these meals, my wife and I decided to split a couple of dishes. We were both interested in testing some rare tuna. When we saw it come out to another table, it looked small and was very high priced. So we came up with a compromise when we saw the fish and chips quantity and price point. About twice the food at half the price. This decision was the best that we could have made. Pair these two dishes with a dozen oysters, and it was a good amount of food.As a person that grew up eating raw oysters in quaint little hole in the walls, I am a traditionalist when it comes to crackers. Something that does not happen in these fancier oyster places. Call me a simpleton if you will, but good ole saltines are what take me back. But in this case, I was more opened minded since I have experienced this a few times in the last few years. These made in house crackers were really good if I think outside of my nostalgia. But I still prefer being offered both options.Overall a great meal that I could tweak in a few areas. But overall, a great first experience at Automatic. Excited to come back."
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,5,"Aside from major national news organizations saying that this place is one of the best new spots in the US, as one who's been here dozens of times it's my favorite spot in the city.First of all, the hours on here are wrong currently.  They offer an amazing brunch menu on both Saturday and Sunday every weekend.Ambience, awesome.  Dark paint with tons of natural lighting.  The bar is gigantic reaching across one of the main exterior walls.  The bathrooms are awesome as well, if anyone is into that sort of thing.Parking, they have a lot and valet at dinner time.  Tons of street parking too.Menu, it's an obvious seafood and oyster spot, so don't get surprised when you don't see chicken fingers.Pro Tip: The Brunch Burger is a religious experience.  If you haven't been, go already!"
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,4,"I have wanted to try Automatic for several months and finally decided to try it for brunch. You can make a reservation online, but when I arrived about half of the tables were open. It was still nice to not have to worry about waiting to be seated. The waiter was quick to take my drink order and food orders, but disappeared afterwards for a while. The food was excellent. I decided to try the quiche which is t something I usually order at places, but I'm glad I tried it. I really enjoyed it and it was the perfect amount of food for me. I did find it a bit odd that they had no salt or pepper on the table for your food. It was a nice meal and I will be back to try it again sometime soon."
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,4,"First time visiting this relatively new restaurant and we were quite impressed. Warm and inviting atmosphere, not stuffy but equally suited to come as you are or dressed for a night on the town. Very open setting with ample seating, bar and oyster bar. Menu isn't large but more than plenty to select from and everything we had was high quality. The only negatives were service was a little slower than you might expect however the waitstaff was highly attentive. The restaurant was busy as well. Secondly, our dessert choice was key lime pie which was largely meringue. Aside from that, outstanding food, location and service given the crowds. Will beBack again."
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,4,"Sunday Brunch and Lunch Expedition continues after a small break. Had Seafood on my mind today and I remembered reading a few reviews on Automatic. Fresh, in season, creative, food & customer focused, location, trendy with a diverse clientele are my first thoughts. Menu changes with seasonal availability and we are not knowledgeable about Standard menu offerings. Smoked Salmon: A crisp potato hash brown base, topped with a smear of cream cheese, pickled red onions, smoked salmon and a wonderful mixture of fresh greens (kale, dill, sorrel & 1 or 2 more tossed in a vinaigrette). We would love a bowl of the fresh green salad, so good. All the components worked together like a symphony. BBQ Shrimp & Grits: topped with a pork belly, tomato, sauce and shrimp. Good, OK ? but not worthy of a do again. There was an off taste that just didn't belong.We will return for the seasonal offerings and creativity."
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,4,"I came here for a work dinner one night during the middle of the week and was surprised to see how packed it was inside for a Wednesday night. The lighting in the room is a bit dark-ish inside, but there is a fair amount of lighting inside. The scenery inside is very nice and gives off the vibe that you are in a restaurant of high class. The restrooms were cool too - they have gender-neutral restrooms, but there's a catch to it: they have four stalls, each in a small room along with a occupied/vacant indicator on the doors, which is helpful! My group had a decent wait for about 15 minutes, but we did have a reservation. While we waited, we did have a server come to us and ask for our drinks. During my time at the restaurant, I ordered two cocktails - On the Fritz (Frozen) and another one that had tequila in it. Both were delicious!The one thing that really took away from the experience was the WAIT - from what our lead person for our group gathered from the staff was that due to a wreck on Highway 280 that a lot of parties ahead of us got stuck in, their kitchen got slammed so our orders got backed up too. Even given the circumstances, it still felt a bit too long to the point where one of our group people couldn't eat. It took about almost two hours for us to eat after we got sat - thankful we had oysters to help the group eat something before our main plates. Ironically, I didn't get to eat any seafood (darn allergies) but I ordered the 12 oz prime ribeye and it was marvelous. It almost made the long wait worth it. The taste melted in my mouth and had exceptional seasoning to accompany it. As for the seafood, the general consensus that I got from my constitutes was that it was quite good. This restaurant is on the pricey side, so have your money prepared it you want to come eat here - I think it can be an exceptional restaurant in due time, but would like to see the service times much quicker. One of my constitutes did say that they got their food much quicker last time they had went to it so it is very possible that the time I went was an anomaly given the wreck."
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,5,"My friend and I came here around 6pm. It was national oyster day and I was originally only planning on downing oysters but I was kind of pulled in by their menu. I didn't know it changed on almost a daily basis so it'll always be a surprise what you can get when you go! We started off with a round of all the oysters and the outlaw was my favorite. The descriptions for them are pretty accurate so you can choose what type you want pretty easily. I also got a fish and chips, just the most basic fish you can get, but it was actually fried perfectly. The fish was extremely flakey and the outside was super crispy. I added some malt vinegar and lime and they tasted delicious! I'm not a giant fan of big potato wedge fries but my friend really enjoyed them and I thought they weren't bad despite me not liking that type. We ordered a couple more sides, non of which I can remember. If you go here though, please ORDER THE ROLLS, wow were they good and I contemplated ordering another round at the end but instead went with more oysters instead!I love the interior of the place and our waiter was super awesome. The outside had some ring toss games and parking isn't hard to find on the street. Hopefully I'll be back soon!"
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,4,"Automatic Seafood is absolutely delicious with a beautiful, modern ambiance. The space is big so you don't feel crowded. I had the blackened amberjack with a side of potato wedges and it was absolutely delicious. I had the smoked fish hushpuppies for an appetizer and again, completely blown away with how good they were. The One Pear of a Tyhme cocktail was refreshing, crisp, and yummy.The only thing I'm knocking a star off for is due to wait time. We had a reservation for 6 people at 6:45 PM and were seated immediately. However, we did not leave the restaurant until 9 PM, as it took over 2 hours for our meal. It didn't really make sense, considering it was a Tuesday night and a normal-sized crowd. Our server was pretty absent, and very slow to bring even a beer."
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,5,"Y'all this place was an absolute treat! Hubs brought me here for my Birthday dinner. There is a 22 seat bar that you can order the full dinner at or wait for your res. The interior is beautiful with table and booth seating throughout. Romantic dim lights for ambiance! Customer service is on point! We ordered the yeast rolls (these are the devil yall!), the heirloom tomatoes (do not skip these) and grilled oysters... this is the first time I've had oysters in my life and these did not disappoint! Full of flavor and no weird texture! We split the hog snapper - absolutely divine, flavor is dynamite! The wedge fries were my least fav...yall know this place is fire if I'm saying the fries were my least fav!!!!!"
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,1,"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Here are my reasons. One star deduction for each item. 1) the fish was too small. I spent $28 on an order of fish. I expect it to at least be the size of a medium hand. It was thin and pitiful. What WAS there was over seasoned and super spicy. I like hot things but there was no flavor but the heat.2) the server wasn't friendly enough. I really didn't feel overly welcomed. The water waiter was nicer than our main server but I got the sense that the the main server thought we were trouble. 3) The service was creepingly slow. There were a lot of people there at a semi-busy dinner time, I understand, but it took too long. There was no bread or crackers for the table. We had to order 4 small rolls to have something to snack on while we waited. It should have been complementary for the amount of time we had to wait. 4. Last but not least... a salad that came to our table was found to have a hair in it. This is basic. You can't be serving hairs to guests! Gag!!All in all the prices are way too high for the experience we got. I was not a happy customer! We all left hungry and went to another place for dessert."
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,3,"It took me awhile to write this review because I wanted to think about it. I came here with the hubs for a date night and I have to say that I was super enthusiastic about coming here because I haven't really found a seafood place that I love in Birmingham so I was excited when I heard about this new one. I think they really want to be a great oyster bar and people probably come here just for that. However, oysters aren't really my thing. If you are coming for oysters you should know that they are 2-3 dollars a piece so, not cheap! The menu isn't huge so choices are limited when it comes to the entrees. I was kind of surprised that there weren't more fish options but I understand they are limited by what's fresh and in season. I decided to have the cobia, hubs got the swordfish. After a considerable wait our fish arrived. It was presented very well but the size of the pieces of fish we got were pretty small. Any time I've ever had swordfish, I've gotten a big steak. My husband's swordfish was smaller than my piece of fish and mine was pretty small. I thought mine tasted really good. I tried hubby's swordfish and I thought it was very bland. I know some people don't care but I hate when you are paying $30 for an entree and that doesn't include any sides. I'm sorry but it can't cost that much to throw a few veggies on there. The side choices that they offered for an additional fee did not thrill me and we had a hard time finding one that sounded appealing to both of us. Despite all this, we decided to get dessert. I got what sounded like an amazing peanut butter cookie dessert which turned out to be a small plate of cookies with three tiny cookies and a piece of almond bark. Disappointing. Hubby got the brown sugar cake which was ok but nothing special. Service was good but a little overbearing. If I was trying to have a romantic night or trying to have a serious conversation I would have been annoyed. Yes, there is such a thing as spending too much time at the guest's table. And this was not just our waiter but another gentleman as well who kept coming over just to chat. All this to say, I doubt we'll be back. I would give it another try in a few months with a friend but I will never convince the hubs to come back."
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,5,"I know I am late to the game here, but I may have turned into a literal incarnation of the praise hands emoji after eating at Automatic. Get thee to this venue, dear friend! It was a Friday night and we were going out on a whim, so we didn't make a reservation, which is highly recommended - we definitely will next time. Luckily we were able to get two seats at the bar which has the full menu service. We each got drinks (beer for him and a cocktail for me, which matched the caliber of any of the nice bars in town), and we ordered a round of the yeast rolls and some oysters. Both were a hit. Our bartender was doing double duty taking our order as well, and he was a professional. Never stopped moving, but made everything looked effortless. Definitely seems like all of their staff is top notch. For dinner, we got the grouper, a side of broccoli, and the lobster rolls which come with some shoestring fries. Y'all - DO NOT SLEEP ON THESE LOBSTER ROLLS. We will each have dreams about them for weeks. So incredible. The fries and the broccoli were also both very good. The grouper was excellent, but since everything else set before us was PACKED with seasoning and flavor, the fish fell a bit short in that department. There were several other things on the menu that I look forward to returning to try. So happy that Automatic has joined the Bham food scene, and I cannot wait to check back in soon."
Automatic Seafood and Oysters,5,"Just a perfect dining experience! The service was exceptional and timely. Our party of 6 enjoyed every minute. Our server was flexible and accommodating to requests from the menu for our child. Get the hush puppies, Caesar salad, and duck-poached swordfish or whole fish!"
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,"Start your experience here off right by asking your waitress/waiter for a ""Notch List"". What is a ""Notch List"" you ask? Well, it's essentially your beer list. It's a piece of paper that you decorate and list the beers you try at Jack Brown's. You make up your own rating system. Wanna be a basic chick? Do a 1-10 system. Wanna be original and draw emojis that represent how each beer makes you feel? DO IT. The world is your oyster.  The beauty of making a list and a rating system is that you can tell the bartender/waitstaff to look at your beer list and choose something for you based on your likes/dislikes. Just be sure to create a legend for your rating system if it's something weird (typically includes a sample of each symbol and a short description of what it means). Otherwise your poor bartender will be looking at your list, lost af, trying to determine whether your sorry excuse for an alien or a pathetic drawing of a devil monster has a higher rating on your scale. You should know there's a $20 fee to get a copy of your list at ALL Jack Brown's locations. However, you can start a list for absolutely nothing. Once you hit your 100th beer, you're officially inducted into the Notcher Club, which means you get a Jack Brown's shirt, your picture on the wall, and access to exclusive Notch Club events.Okay, enough about the Notch Club, let's get down to the nitty gritty bullshit.You want a dive bar feel with craft beer and brewery stickers plastered all over the wall like the collage you made in high school art class? Here you go. Is your heart seeking a place with multicolored Christmas lights strung from the ceiling perfectly highlighting a taxidermy Jackalope? Guess what? That stuffed cutie is mounted on the back wall and draped in Mardi Gras beads. Been searching for a bar with a chandelier adorned with an array of bras in all shapes, sizes, and colors? Well, look no further. This is the place for you. The ambiance is amazing. From the lighting, to the music, to the actual bar which is made from repurposed high school lockers, this place is baller af.The beer selection is on point and always changing. They also feature seasonal beers! The burgers are original (The Elvis Burger with peanut butter!) and each is nothing short of perfection. My personal favorite is the, ""COWBOY Burger topped with BBQ sauce, Applewood Smoked Bacon and American Cheddar blend cheese"".The sweet potato fries are also *holds both thumbs way way up*.Don't even get me started on their ""special sauce"". I'm half convinced there's crack in it because I cannot stop eating it. Seriously, I'd bathe in it if it were actually hygienic. All I can say is, TRY THIS PLACE! You won't regret it!"
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,4,"COBRA KAI: Burger topped with cream cheese, picked jalapeños and Jalapeño jelly all between two potato buns. Easily one of my favorites in my home town state of Alabama!* Saturday's are Freestyle Burger Day**A perfect concoction of toppings that varies each week. Check with your beer-tender or their IG: @jack_browns_bham for details on the burger of the week. * The Burger menu is crazy! You're going to want to make multiple trips just to try them all. From burger like POPEYE- with house-made spinach-artichokes is, pepper jack cheese, and fried onions. Or the ELVIS topped with PB and bacon. There's something for everyone!"
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,4,"Talk about a hole in the wall! Strictly just an alley way converted to a bar and grill. If it is clean in here, you cannot tell. The back porch was busy but we didn't wait long. Choice of designer burgers is limited but great. We tried three different kinds of burgers. Cool names and great flavor combinations. Kobra Kia burger was great. Willy's Craft Burger of the Day was excellent. Shocker minus the habanero was very tasty albeit warm. Burger size is the only issue. Very small meat to burger ratio. I've seen more meat on a Big Mac. Please get the toilet in the ladies room fixed. It may not be attached to the floor."
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,"I'm not even a burger person, but Jack Browns has the best burgers hands down and the fries OMG. So crispy and just perfect everytime. The beer selection is great, a wide variety from Banana Bread to a pink colored beer. Great spot. The Cobra Kai you can't go wrong. Really all of the burgers are great and the sauce! Don't forget the sauce. Just put it on everything!"
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,4,"Went here for a meet up and was excited to try a burger. My first impression was how narrow the seating was. I prefer a more open seating area and I think there is more space upstairs and in the back, but we sat out front. I ordered the Chupacabra Burger with Pepper Jack and Goat Cheese melted together, and boy, was that delicious. The burger was well cooked and juicy. The bun was soft and the bun to burger ratio was perfect. You have a choice between crinkled regular fries or sweet potato fries. I had the latter and they were very good. To top it off, I had a fried Oreo and it was ooey and gooey and not oily. Overall, a very good experience and I'll be back to try more burgers."
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,1,"I had really been wanting to give this place a try, So we decided to go for lunch to celebrate my birthday with family.I was a little surprised that when we arrived at 12:30 on Sunday all the tables were already taken. We were directed to the patio for more seating. There was only one table left there as well.Server/Bartender greeted us promptly and took drink orders. He was ready for our food orders when he returned with the drinks quickly.Wait for our food was longer than expected but reasonable. That's were the experience went downhill.Food itself was great. I had the Greg Brady Burger - Wagyu Beef patty topped with Mac & Cheese, American Cheddar Blend & Martin's BBQ potato chips. Wife had the Cobra Kai - burger topped with cream cheese, pickled jalapeños and jalapeño jelly. Son chose the Chiplet - burger topped with Applewood smoked bacon, Egg and American Cheddar Cheese. Daughter went with the only vegetarian entree The Frankie Brady - grilled cheese on potato roll with 2 slices of cheese, Mac & cheese and BBQ potato chips. Again we all liked the food and agreed that would order again.Unfortunately the server never checked on us after the food arrived. He was too preoccupied with talking/joking with other employees and his phone. Finally my on went to the bar are ordered another drink and asked for a up of ice for my wife.As we were finishing up he did eventually come check on us get my daughter a refill on her tea and take our order for some fried Oreos.Shortly after that apparently he left and another server/bartender took over the patio. After waiting a really long time for the dessert, never being checked on by the new server despite checking on and taking orders from the adjacent tables, I finally went to the bar to cancel the order and request the check. She proceeded to throw her co-worker under the bus and say the order was never put in and he told me your table was all set. How hard would it have been to turn and ask if we were still good while adjacent to the table one of the 4 times (since her back seemed to always be to us we couldn't get her attention). If for no other reason I would have thought check to try and get us to move on & turn the table since multiple parties had come looking for an empty table.While she did get the manager to give a discount due to the issues, it was not enough to make up for the multiple problems and he didn't bother to say anything despite knowing I was standing next to the bar waiting on the ticket.My son wants me to give it another chance because he has had a good experience before. With so many other options I just don't know if I will."
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,1,Waiters are very racist! Treated my good friend very badly. Will never ever be coming back. So racist.....
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,"A great spot to grab some local brews and delicious burgers. They don't include tomatoes and lettuce on their burgers - so basically they take their burgers very seriously, haha.They have a special burger for ever day of the week with a weekly changing special on Saturdays. The Chiflet burger is my favorite. Highly recommend getting a side of the sweet potato fries. Hope to one day be brave enough to try the Elvis."
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,I can't believe I am just now trying this place!! We started off our meal with a fried Oreo which I think is super cool that you can order them individually -- they were perfect!! If you haven't tried one before you have to come here and get one. The Oreo somehow turns into that perfect 'milk dunked' texture in the batter. The batter is not too thick and does not overshadow the Oreo! My hubby and I decided we would share a burger since it was late. We then ordered the Greg Brady burger first thinking that it would be enough to share-- errr wrong!! The burger was (a) too good to share but (b) one of the smallest burgers I've ever had out. I say this in a good way.. it still packed all of the flavor but it was insanely manageable to eat with no mess but all the goodness! The bun perfectly hugged the burger and it was perfect just the way it came. We soon ordered the cobra Kai which was also tasty but I definitely like the Greg Brady better! The cobra Kai was a burger version of a cream cheese and pepper jelly dish. We both thought the cobra Kai burger meat was not as seared/salted as the Brady but it could have been our imagination. Will definitely be back to try all the burgers on this menu! They have regular fries and sweet potato fries that are crinkle cut-- kind of plain on their own but they have Cajun seasoning on the table and a yum yum ranchy cajuny sauce on the table for them that pulls everything together. We sat out back where they have heaters so you can enjoy being outside without the chill this fall/winter! Will be back -- hopefully soon!
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,Wow.......burgers we're delicious!!!  Their sweet potato fries with the white sauce.......I could eat them until I'm sick!  Honestly!!!!!  I love the homemade taste of the burgers and I love the buns heated on the griddle with the burgers!  I had the Dr. Gonzo.....if you love mushrooms and onions with a ton of Swiss cheese...get this burger!!  I'll be back....soon!
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,4,Jack Browns is easily a town favorite and yet I seem to always forget about it. I was in the area and searching for a good burger. This is the place. Especially if you like beef! Their buns are light and toasted. Their burgers are some of the best in the city! They also don't charge you astronomical prices. A good burger and fry for around $10 is slightly more than fast food and 1000% better. Well worth a visit if you haven't been. They also have really YUMMY sweet potato fries. The only negative I would say is that they don't really have a traditional burger with lettuce and tomato. I also didn't see a vegetarian option but hey... it is a burger joint. Fried Oreos are definitely worth ruining any diet for. Customer service was good. Beer selection is one of the most verse ones I've seen. They usually have the games going on the weekend. Not much more you can ask for.
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,"Killer - in town for work, within walking distance of trimtab brewery. Ordered cobra Kai burger and sweet potato fries. They provide squeeze bottles of this swanging sauce. 1$ fried Oreos to finish. It was so good went back a second day in a row before head back home."
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,"Came here with a coworker, definitely an excellent recommendation.  Tried the Elvis (yes, peanut butter on a burger), and it was delicious.  Fries were good, and they have quite the extensive list of local/craft brews.  I would definitely want to try one of their other burgers next time I'm in the Birmingham area."
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,This place is awesome! I was just trying to find a place to get some food when i landed from AZ at 12:30 at night. Didnt expect to get such great food at this hour. Had a burger and it was amazing! I ordered a 2nd! Such an awesome burger. Was really impressed! Also the fried oreo so amazing! Blake was an epic server! Loved sitting at her table! So friendly! Got to also talk to nick who was awesome as well! If I'm ever in Birmingham again I'll definitely go to this place!
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,"Wow, a party in my mouth. A coworker decided to let me in on this piece of heaven. I'm glad he did. I wanna escape there every day. I got a beer and the Elvis burger which was a cheeseburger with peanut butter. Who knew those two things went together like peas and carrots. Yum. I will return my friend."
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,4,"The place has an amazing atmosphere, it perfectly captures the corrupted seedy elegance of a dive bar and the music played at a volume just enough to be loud but not deafening and overriding any conversation. Plus, the music choices show the taste of a music connoisseur. The place has a good beerselection and the bartenders are attentive. Now, for the burgers. They are good. I had the Shocker, which is their hot and spicy offering with jalapeno peppers and habanero peppers. They say it is wagyu beef, an American version of Kobe beef, but I did not find it to be a standout.The burgers are on the small side and for the price point, a bit steep. I would guess they aren't even a quarter pound. I had a burger and fries with water and before a tip it was $11.54.Again, the food was decent and I am sure it gets pretty jumping at night."
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,4,"Late night burgers & beer are always a win in my book! & this place does both really well. I love the dive bar  atmosphere & the no fuss menu is the icing on the cake. Wasn't in the mood for a burger so I opted for the Frankie Brady - A grilled cheese stuffed with Mac & cheese & BBQ chips. While it wasn't horrible, I really should've gotten a burger. My friend got the Cowboy with sweet potato fries and it was delicious. Crispy fries, just the way I like em! & the sauce they serve with it, is beyond good on anything. A few cold beers and a cool patio to enjoy the night, for the price, I wasn't disappointed at all. Also the staff is really sweet & laid back. I have definitely found my new late night food & beer spot. & I'm eyeing the fried Oreos..."
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,This restaurant/Bar is one of my go to spots in Birmingham Alabama they have the most amazing burgers I have ever had in my life but they also have a great selection of beer. When I went there recently I only went for the seasonal beer they added to the menu and the beer was amazing. If you're in the neighborhood stop by and give their Ace Pumpkin Cider a try.
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,"A classic. Who knew peanut butter on a burger would be THAT good?? If you're deciding between this place and literally ANY other place, go here. Maybe call ahead of time to check the wait though because it gets crowded. Unique burgers packed with flavor or the classic cheeseburger, you seriously can't go wrong. Check out the daily special and if the weather is nice sit outside in the back patio"
Jack Brown’s Beer & Burger Joint,5,"Love this burger place. I have always heard people talking about it and finally decided to check it out about a year ago. I typically eat here for lunch on Mondays, since most places are closed around Avondale that day. I've never had a bad experience here, even when there is a slight wait. I usually get the Dr. Gonzo burger, but the others I've tried are just as good. If you like sweet potato fries, you have to try them here. They are amazing (especially with their house sauce). They have tables, bar seating, and an outside patio. The atmosphere is laid back and the service is always fast. I've only been here once at night, for New Years, and it was a super fun time. They have a huge beer list. Definitely recommend for lunch or drinks after work!!"
Unplugged,5,"Once you find this spot, settle in for amazing food, awesome staff, and a unbelievable happy hour. Oh and a flashback to the 90's. I was the last to arrive but was immediately greeted by lots of smiling faces, a review of the menu and 90's music. I immediately ordered a Crunk Juice and the Pizza Fries. The spicy marinara sauce and the pepperoncini mayo were to die for. The fries by themselves were also really good. I also had a Boozy Palmer and it's one of the reasons I'm thinking of going back today. Overall, great spot, and I can't wait to go back!"
Unplugged,4,"A welcomed addition to the 5 Points South entertainment district.  It's a 90's themed bar with a modern take on all your favorite childhood snacks. Gushers, Bagel Bites, Mozzarella Sticks, Fish Sticks...all delicious. The drinks are too sweet for my tastes but they do have a full bar aside from the house cocktails. There's a rad patio area behind it."
Unplugged,4,"Overall I had a great time at unplugged. We originally went to Mcflys, but it was too crowded. The space was a pretty cool little space. Not exactly easy to find if you didn't know it was there. But definitely a cool vibe back there. Unplugged has a nice size menu of drinks and food. If that's nnot enough, you can order food from mcflys bird shop and they will bring it to your table at unpluggef. This was especially helpful for my wife. She is a vegan, and was able to order food from mcflys. The drinks were tasty. But they were like a normal signature cocktail. Great flavor, low alcohol content. The menu is like a modern take on 90's dishes/snacks. Hamburger helper, uncrustables, hot pockets etc eels I had the hamburger helper dish. It was Better that what old hamburger helper use to be. But still nothing really out of this world. It did have a fried egg and a large piece of avocado on it. The egg and Avocado went really well with the dish."
Unplugged,4,"This place is adorable and nostalgic to those of us that remember the 90's! I'll say if  you don't know it's there you may pass it a dozen times looking for it. It's in an alley - neon signage. The facility: It's small y'all!! It's big enough to be a bar - periodt. The bar will seat about 20 and there's a small seating area that could comfortably handle an additional 10 - 15. The decor is is colorful w/black and neon graffitied wall areas and lights in the ceiling. The bar has purse hooks which I soooo appreciate!Food/drink: I had the munchable which was an adult Lunchable kind of? Really good! I tried the Tang spritz - I'd definitely order  that again. The food comes from McFly, btw! No complaints at all there.It pretty chilly in there so  I'm glad I had my sweater that day!"
Unplugged,5,"Ok!! It's 90s themed!! I always say I'm an 80s baby, but the 90s made me.  I love all things 90s especially food, drinks,  and music. I was able to try the Thanks Emeril salad.  I mean who doesn't love and miss the Bam!! It had romaine lettuce,  roasted Turkey, ham,  cheddar,  white American cheese, avocado,  deviled egg spread, and paprika vinaigrette.  It was delicious!! I paired it with the That's my jam!! It's a drink made with coconut rum,  raspberry liqueur,  elderflower liqueur,  strawberry jam,  and citrus juice.  The atmosphere is super chill and laid back. This will definitely be added to my Friday night shenanigans!!"
Unplugged,4,"You have to be in the know to find this place! It is a cool out of the way 90s themed bar in 5 points S. They have food items such as Funkaroos, Hamburglar Helper, Santa's Little Helper and the McStuffin. The food is made at McFlys a restaurant in the front.There is a small outside area in the back. There are heaters but I can't wait until spring. Happy Hour is from 4 pm to 6pm and runs Tuesday through Sunday.My favorite happy drink is the Crunk Juice.Check this place out!"
Unplugged,4,"Cool 90's themed bar in the heart of 5 Points South. I love the location of this bar because it's almost hidden. I can see great potential for this place especially in the spring/summer seasons because there is a really spacious patio. The 90's themed drink and food menu is really nostalgic for me especially growing up in the 90's. The only downside is the price point for well drinks are a bit pricey in my opinion. Overall, this is a great addition to Birmingham and I will be back."
Unplugged,4,"Cool new 90's themed bar and lounge off of 20th st. In Five Points South Just recently opened this place brings back some nostalgia for those who grew up in the 90's connected to mcflys a restaurant that serves unique chicken fingers, unplugged has its own unique menu as well with the likes of bagel bites and fiddlesticks or fish sticks. You'll hear the speakers blasting old 90's music and the TVs playing American gladiators or unsolved mysteries lol.A nice place to hang out with friends and reminisce and laugh. Cocktails seem pretty cool too I usually just stick to my basic drink so haven't tried anything but my wife enjoyed her drinks she had. Will definitely visit again."
Unplugged,4,"well can you say hideaway. This place is that. I have been partying on South-side for years and never knew this place was here. We were out looking for a happy hour spot before dinner. and found this on yelp. Googled it and of course it was not located correctly. so after asking around we finally got directed to the place. We went down a side alley off 20th St. between 11th Ave and the Homewood Suites. At the end of the alley was the bar. It was a small cozy affair with an outside sitting area with tables and umbrellas. It was raining and chilly so we sat inside at the bar. We ordered their happy hour signature cocktails. They were good, but  the recipes were unique consisting of drink made using Tang or Kool Aid flavours. They have a food menu that is from the restaurant at the corner of the alley and 20th St. McFly's Bird Shoppe so food is available and will be brought to you. The barkeeps were friendly and attentive and won't let your glass go dry.We will return on a warmer day so we can enjoy the outside area."
Unplugged,5,"You down with O.P.P? Well if you can finish the song come on down to Unplgged! It's a 90s throwback for ya! Don't be afraid to walk down the alley to a spot that will have you walking down memory Lanez. The venue is very cozy and Gladiators is playing on the TV.  The tunes are bumping from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beastie Boys, Outkast, to Jodeci!!! This was my first time and I was basically scouting the spot for my group. You gotta have the crunk juice, followed by the frozen gushers, then followed by the gin & juice, and last but definitely not least the creamsicle. All the items on the menu are named after some of the popular items back in the 90s. The food comes from McFlys Bird Shoppe. Talk about killing two birds with one stone. Mims is a great proprietor and bartender. I thought he was going to kick us out! We just entered a new decade, but we can always relive the past!"
Unplugged,5,This was a cool night cap spot. Just waking and came upon it. It's nice for groups or just to go chill. Interesting selections of music. Best part got to be the staff they were super cool. They do serve food but I did not get a chance to try it yet but everything I saw looked great! Definitely will be back for a visit when it warms up bc they have an enclosed patio with park benches to hang out!
Unplugged,4,"It's cute little 90's theme bar in 5pts. They have 90's signature cocktails and play 90's music as well. The wall is decorated with 90's graphics that I remember from childhood. The bar is built in container with nice size back porch. They also had 90's theme food restaurants attached called ""Mcfly"". I'm definitely going to try it when I'm out with friends again. I had creamsicle cocktails, it was tasty but it did get sweeter end of it. They do sell beer and truly as well."
Unplugged,5,"Diva, Ross and Mims are amazing! A lot of the drinks are on the way too sweet side for me, however, I can always count on Diva to make me something that my pallet appreciates. The place is pure 90's nostalgia.  The music, the look, the vibe. The food brings you back to childhood greatness, but amped up for your adult tastebuds. I'd definitely recommend this as a place that everyone should experience at least once."
Unplugged,5,"What a cool concept!! Love this addition to the 5 points area. Me and a dear friend stopped by on a Tuesday around 9 and it was pleasantly busy but not crowded. The menu is pretty extensive, and they also provide a menu for McFlys if you're feeling that instead. I ordered the BBQ Bloody Mary and my friend got the gushers drink. The blood mary was good but nothing to write home about. Her drink was actually pretty rad, very sweet and fruity and it had a gusher in the drink that looked suspiciously like a cherry. The bartender helping us was FREAKIN AMAZING. Someone give Tracy a raise please!!! She was so super sweet and attentive, and helped us navigate the extensive food menus. We ended up ordering the mozzarella sticks which are covered in potato chips. Um hello that's a genius move. They are SO GOOD. But the best thing I think we got was the Munchables. Basically a grown up lunchables/charcuterie board but they give you an abundance of goodies. And it was all very very good. The mustard and the honey they serve it with was a stellar combo. Overall, Unplugged is totally all that and a bag of chips."
Unplugged,5,"I had an amazing dinner tonight, Unplugged serves a great burger, but it was the best hot dog of my life. Thanks you guys!"
Unplugged,5,"I had been reading about this place and was super excited to try it! We stopped in on a Friday night while waiting on a table at Hot and Hot.  I ordered the gushers drink (name escapes me!) which was sweet and deliscious and had an actual gusher in it!  The service was quick and friendly and there are a lot of interesting drinks and food items on their menu I Look forward to trying!  The atmosphere is fun, hip and inviting.  It's winter now, but I look forward to coming back and enjoying their fun courtyard!"
Unplugged,4,"Love all the new bars coming into the area! I had been wanting to try unplugged since trying McFly's by the same owners, and finally made my way back! Unplugged is a chill, 90s themed bar. Think drinks with hi-c, tang, and gushers in them and food like bagel bites or with names from our favorite tv shows. There's outside picnic tables, bar seating and about 5 standard booths. I loved that there were so many drink and food options, all of which were reasonably priced (cocktails running 9-11 dollars). While the cocktails were novel and nostalgic, I did find them a little sweet and not very strong. I had the crunk juice and frozen gusher. We also tried some food-- the long shot favorite was the potato chip mozz sticks. So good, crispy, and piping hot! The pizza tots and bagel bites were also good. You can also order anything off the standard McFlys menu as well. They have a pretty food happy hour which I will try to come back for from 4-6pm Tues-Sun that has some 6$ cocktails, 4$ wells, and 3/4$ beers. I can't wait to come and sit outside once it gets a little warmer!"
Unplugged,4,"Good music, good drink selection.  Interesting menu which would be great for a group. Only complaint, make sure everyone starts tabs or don't do it. Being consistent is critical. Watched two tabs at the bar handled differently.  Other than great experience."
Unplugged,5,"Talk about unique! When you're walking down 20th Street in 5 Points South toward The Woolworth, you've probably seen construction going on down an alley. That alley now leads to a 90's themed bar made of shipping containers with a big outdoor area. The drinks are fun and the staff take their craft seriously. There's a rotating ""Unplugged"" beer on tap, ask them the type (lager, IPA, etc). The menu is basically adult versions of the stuff you ate when you were a kid playing video games, think bar-food takes on hot pockets, hamburger helper, dunkaroos, etc. Great first date spot, intimate lighting, good music, indoor/outdoor vibe, etc. You can also take your drinks throughout the alley and even into McFly's (the chicken place up front, if you can't find something you like on the menu)."
Unplugged,4,"Great vibe, loved the graffiti look on the walls and American Gladiator playing on tv. The drinks really brought me back in time and had very creative names and ingredients. Bartender was super friendly! Will definitely be stopping back by here again to try the food next time."
El Barrio,5,"Got curbside pick up from El Barrio last night with friends. First time trying their dinner menu. This place has me sold on their brunch. El Barrio takes the concept of Mexican Food and gives it a modern flair.For starters, got the guac, cheese dip and salsa which were plenty enough for the three of us. Guacamole dazzled with its creamy texture but the salsa was more on the sweeter side, different but good. For you salty salsa enthusiasts, perhaps not a good pick. For my main, I went with the grilled chorizo meatloaf. It is a delightful experience going through the different layers of flavor from the tender meat, creamy potatoes and spinach. They all came together to make this dish intensely delicious.The prices are shill decent for a non traditional Mexican restaurant and if the prices deter you, don't. This place is worth spending a little extra for all the tasty items they have to offer.El Barrio already had my pick as one of Birmingham's note worthy restaurants and dinner last night further proved that."
El Barrio,5,"This review was written during the COVID-19 Quarantine. I'm going to sing praises or el Barrio's customer service! What we ordered: Veggie, Quesadilla, barbacoa quesadilla, and their delicious salsa for pick up. We arrived and  our food was brought out to us at the car. We left and 5 mins later got a call that they may have forgotten to pack our salsa and asked if we would turn around. When we arrived the sweet woman was standing outside waiting on us. To our surprise she packed 2x salsa, a delicious guacamole, a coke, a jarrito and some plantain chips! She apologized and we couldn't believe how she made up for it! Not to say that one should expect free food everytime, but they know how to make you feel like a valued customer. I had never had the quac or plantain chips but will be getting next time. All of our food was delicious!"
El Barrio,5,"Line of about 25 outside when we arrived at 4:58 on a Saturday evening. Doors opened right at 5:00. Our party of two was seated by 5:04 (got very crowded and had a wait right after we got seated). Our server, Kevin, was awesome. Great attention to detail and we never felt rushed. We ordered the chunky guacamole and an order of salsa. The guac was simple, cilantro, jalapeño, avocado and served with a lime (loved being able to add extra to my taste). Our server brought refills for our chips and salsa literally as we finished our first serving! Didn't even have to ask. We waited to order our food until our appetizers arrived. There was a bit longer of a wait for our meal to be delivered, but again, at this point the restaurant was packed. We ordered the potato taquitos, roasted chili relleno, and the chopped romaine and spinach salad. When we ordered, our server offered to have the chili relleno (entree) divided into two places for us which was great! We throughly enjoyed all our items and all were excellent portion sizes. We were both absolutely stuffed leaving and had food to go.  This is a more rustic, traditional style Mexican restaurant with their own flare. Simple ingredients and meals with great flavors. One thing I always appreciate at a restaurant is a staff who is working hard and working together well. This is definitely the case at El Barrio!"
El Barrio,5,Al Carbon Tacos were awesome. Ask for the sweet lime crema on the side and make sure to drizzle it over everything. Sooooo tasty! Tried the barbacoa quesadilla and it was delicious.
El Barrio,4,"Previously had only been here for drinks, of which they are pretty well known for, especially their margaritas. We finally decided to give their food a shot.We started off with the ceviche - a must try for us. We love ceviche. My wife liked theirs a little more than I did as they were a little heavy on the onions and cilantro. The queso dip was very flavorful, but a little runny. We got a shrimp quesadilla and the veggie quesadilla, and both were great. I liked the dipping sauce for the shrimp quesadilla more, as it helped give it a bright note. The veggie quesadilla was a little earthy for me. Overall, very happy with the trip and I'd come back again."
El Barrio,4,"My travel plans have put me in Birmingham so often that I got sick of my go-to restaurant and decided to try this instead. It didn't look like the most happening area, and it was a Tuesday with not great weather, but people were flocking to this restaurant. I grabbed a seat at the bar rather than wait for a table. Service at the bar wasn't the quickest; I was glad I put plenty of time on my parking meter.The chile relleno I ordered was quite impressive. It had everything I wanted (beans, cheese, pine nuts, and vegetables all over some nicely seasoned rice) and nothing I didn't want (that's a negatory on squash, broccoli, cauliflower, or their ilk, other Mexican restaurants). This was a really excellent combination of flavors. I considered other vegetarian and vegan options, of which there were a decent few.One has to pay for chips and salsa, but they are worth it. Even more so when you consider that when I asked to take half my chips to go as a snack for the road, they gave me a full order of fresh chips and salsa packaged to go. If anything, this was excessive and perhaps wasteful as my original chips were still just sitting there, but I'm sure I'll eat them."
El Barrio,4,"Cold rainy days are good days to warm your innards with good Barrio deliciousness.Green Pozole was Mexican Pho good, it had a bit more bite than my wife would like but she didn't put her spoon down till she couldn't eat anymore. Come hungry for this one it's plentiful and good.Pan Roasted Salmon was so so good. Salmon cook perfect, green rice, garlic mojo, plantains etc were a marriage made for eating. Great service and atmosphere. Parking can be a bit of a problem and a walk but worth it."
El Barrio,5,"My husband and I LOVE this place! It is our favorite restaurant in Birmingham and we go almost monthly. The wait on weekends is always horrendous, an hour or more, so that's something to know before you go. But it's worth the wait! They have great cocktails, the staff is always friendly and if it's too crowded to wait, there's a great bar (Collins Bar) walking distance away so you can go sit and have drinks while you wait. They text you when the table is ready so that's  very convenient. The bacon quesadilla is the absolute best! My husband and I both get that each time. The goat cheese queso is also a top fav! You can't go wrong with El Barrio!"
El Barrio,5,"Somehow this was my first time to El Barrio. I had tried to eat here several times over the years, but they always have a wait for a reason. It didn't take too long before we were seated. We were quickly brought chips and salsa to eat.I enjoyed my margarita and tasted someone else's and enjoyed theirs as well. For my meal I got the chorizo meatloaf. It's a huge portion and is such a unique item to order. I've never had anything like it before. The flavor was great and I happily had the leftovers for lunch he next day. Will definitely plan to eat here again soon!"
El Barrio,5,"Came to the wonderful establishment on a Thursday afternoon for lunch and it was busy, busy, BUSY! I came in a group of 5, and we ended up sitting at the bar since we didn't want to wait for an open table. They make the most of a relatively small space, but I can imagine this place is regularly packed. The server at the bar was very friendly! He told me that have a vegan/vegetarian menu.......then admitted that there wasn't a physical menu and I could modify almost everything to make it vegan lol So, that's what I did! I ordered the quesadilla but substituted the cheese for refried black beans, and it was the best quesadilla I've ever had! I really wish I lived nearby so that I could be a regular here. This would be my go-to meal. The salad was amazing. It was the first thing to go! Very fresh ingredients--the dressing was very good! However, the second best thing were the yummy chips! Not sure if they're fresh, but I loved them! The salsa was okay, but a tad bland. Lastly, there's only street parking and it's metered. *eyeroll*"
El Barrio,5,"Atmosphere:Nicely decorated, darker lighting, great place to catch up with friends. Pretty busy, pretty loud. Food:Al pastor tacos - man were they delicious. The pork is full of flavor, absolutely love the sauce in it. The pickled onions and cabbage mix give the tacos some tangyness and crunch. Queso fundido - I just love queso, and man do they make it well. I believe theirs is goat cheese based, which gives it an extra tangy twist. Absolutely loved it. Guacamole- well made, fresh avocados. A great addition to anything that you order. Spicy mezcal margarita- must try. They aren't cheap on the alcohol. Service: A bit slow, but still good considering how many tables our waitress had. We had a great time, didn't even notice the time go by."
El Barrio,4,"I have not ordered anything else from their menu besides the beef barbacoa quesadilla and I probably never will because it is just that good. Why fix something that isn't broken?? The amount of flavorful meat and gooey cheese this place stuffs between the tortilla astounds me every time. As if it's not good enough on its own, go ahead and just drown that thing in the chipotle sauce it comes with, shut your eyes, and I'm pretty sure you get a glimpse of Jesus. Usually I just eat half of the quesadilla and take the rest home because I'm already full at that point. The salad is good too (sometimes a little overly dressed) and I like the refreshing crunch from the radishes. The chips, salsa and guacamole are fantastic. Esp the chips, they're substantial and crisp. Overall ambience of the place is hip and fun; colorful art and loud pieces adorn the walls. Also love that their takeout boxes are made of paper rather than the traditional styrofoam at many other places. I've also heard their drinks are good but I've never had. I assume the rest of the menu is as superb as the quesadilla but I will probably never venture away because once again, why fix something that isn't broken? Only downside to this place is that sometimes it can take 5ever to get seated but rest assured, it's well worth it!!"
El Barrio,4,"Such a beautiful place! The art and decor really suits the aesthetic of El Barrio. I ordered the beef barbacoa quesadilla and I was truly surprised at how much I enjoyed this meal due to my biased opinion with barbacoa. I will say parking is a hassle (it's downtown, parking is always a hassle). Luckily for me I was able to secure a spot right in front."
El Barrio,5,"After numerous recommendations over the years we were finally able to try El Barrio and oh man it was well worth the wait. This place is always bustling. The hostess greeted us promptly and was so friendly. She informed us it would be a 30-45 minute wait. We lallygagged around the neighborhood (there are a few bars within walking distance to enjoy). Once we returned we snagged a few spots at the bar. The bartender greeted us quickly. We ordered a strawberry margarita and it was light, delicious, and so fresh. We decided on the queso and added the chorizo. Honestly the best queso we've had. And the chips were just as good. I got the steak tacos and he got the barbaco quesadilla. The tacos were so good. The steak was so flavorful, tortillas were fresh, and the cabbage was a great added crunch. The quesadilla was so big, crispy, and full of flavor. In my opinion El Barrio is the best bang for your buck."
El Barrio,5,"I would give this place more stars if I could. It was really busy for a s Tuesday night, we were lucky to grab two seats at the bar after a 10-15 minute wait. Our bartender was outstanding. You could tell he has been mixing drinks for awhile.  The food was excellent,  highly highly recommend!"
El Barrio,5,"Whenever I'm craving Mexican, this is the place I desire to go. It's more high-end Mexican fare but it is sooooo good and fresh. My favorite to get is their salsa and ceviche, it's so freaking fresh and delicious!!! If you're in Birmingham, please visit this place."
El Barrio,5,Awesome Ambience Food People Drinks!!!A must visit when in B'ham....45 min wait is usual
El Barrio,5,"This place is AMAZE-BALLS. The chicken enchiladas are like no other, the customer service is outstanding. It's a comfortable spot located down town that you will not regret checking out. I highly recommend. **all smiles** EVERYTHING's Good."
El Barrio,5,"2nd Time at El Barrio - Did not disappoint once againWe got there 10 minutes to 5, and there was a line again. You know it is popular when people are standing in the cold with skinny jackets in 40 degree weather. Fortunately, we were the first Twenty people there (lol) We had the followingAppetizers: A. Shrimp Ceviche - 3 stars - could be a little bit more citrus taste and the taste of the shrimp was minimalB. Queso Fundido w chips - 4 starsC. Plantain Nachos - 5 stars - shredded pork, crispy thin plantain, cotija cheese, pickled jalapeños Entree's:A. Veggie Quesadilla - 5 stars - spinach, goat cheese, mushrooms, charred corn and roasted garlic tomato salsaB. Al Pastor - 4 stars - corn tortillas w diced pork with pineapple chunksC. Chicken Mole - 4.5 stars - braised chicken thighs with mole, butternut squash, sweet peppers, pepitas on a bed of white rice - Sorry no pictureD. Spicy Chicken Tostada - 4.5 stars - roasted diced chicken w red sauce, poblano, peacons, guacamole, cotijaService was excellent - 5 stars Attentive and efficient for servers and helpersPlace was loud and crowded. Get there early. Especially on Valentines Day!   NOTE: Saturday Brunch service has a limited special menu - not your normal weekly menu"
El Barrio,5,"Why 5 stars? Because the shrimp quesadilla was absolutely perfect.   ---   ---   ---After a brief stay in Birmingham, Will B and I grabbed lunch here before I was off to the airport. I've always been a huge fan of quesadillas, so when I saw that the shrimp quesadilla was one of the highlighted options, my decision came to me pretty easily.I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. The lime crema that came with it is what really made it. As I write this review from back home, I look fondly upon my experience at El Barrio and wish I could make a return trip there right now. Damn that 10-hour commute to Birmingham!Parking wasn't the easiest to find here, even with noted B-Ham expert, Will, at the helm. We eventually settled into a paid lot, much to William's chagrin, after a few failed attempts at finding street parking. But it was all worth it for those crema doused quesadillas."
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"The first thing I noticed when walking into the patio to the restaurant was how neat and orderly and clean everything was- I appreciate this! Greeted by nice lady, waitress, both ordered the BLTGT, which was a bacon, lettuce, fried green tomato and pimento cheese sandwich. The proportions of each ingredient were perfect- none over powering the other- just perfect harmony. A really tasty sandwich!!I did not eat my fries that day, but they must have been good, because my lunch partner did.A very nice man checked on us. I think the very nice lady and very nice man may be the owners.Very friend, clean restaurant with very good good. Look forward to going back and trying something else!"
The Thirsty Donkey,4,"First time eating here and the food is pretty good and the owner is even nicer.We went during brunch, so unfortunately the menu is limited and the vegan options are even scarcer.I ordered the vegan burger with fries. Both were cooked to order and cooked very well. The vegan patty is Morningstar. And the bread is vegan too! The patty was juicy and the fries crispy.I would definitely return during dinner to try more vegan options from the full menu."
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"I've been wanting to try this new establishment for a while now, and I finally went on my birthday a few weeks ago. Everything was impressive: the service, the drink prices and options, the food, and the ambiance. Our server was friendly and took note it was my birthday. Minutes later, I was given a free bottle of cava (champagne) for our table and one of the owners came by to greet us; it just so happens it was her birthday too, so that made my day! The food was excellent. I had the fish and chips(offered Friday only!) and my wife got the Conecuh sliders. Both were delicious and good portion size for the price. The price point is VERY reasonable for the quality of food and drinks you get. The fish was breaded perfectly and the sauce and slaw that came with it was good. The pain killer drink I had was fantastic with a rather cool presentation: it had a gummy in it! The overall atmosphere was good and loud but it was a Friday night. They have great spacious seating outside for good weather days with many umbrellas but also a decent amount of seating inside as well. I will definitely be coming back here more in the future. Highly recommend if you want a good, chill atmosphere with a taste of the Caribbean!"
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"Great atmosphere and a breath of fresh air for the City of Birmingham.  Thank you for opening this store...are there any more in the pipeline?In any manner, the food, drinks and staff is superb, and really enjoy visiting this location.Greg & Kathy, you're the best and we love what you do for the City of Birmingham.  We need to find a way to have you cloned."
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"Such a cool addition to one of my favorite areas of town. The story behind the owners, Kathy and Greg,  is really cool. They originally lived in Birmingham and decided to move to the virgin islands and open a restaurant. It wasn't long before hurricanes put things on hold and sent them back to Birmingham. I have been able to meet both of them and they are really nice people who are doing some really cool things.After hearing of their opening, I was really excited about trying out the Thirsty Donkey. So when we had a brunch where we were looking for a place to go, we jumped at coming here with our kids. Note, that when we went, they also did Saturday Brunch. But now they only do Sunday Brunch. With this place being relatively new in a very popular area, the wait seemed like it could be a while. But before we could finish one mimosa, we were seated.The brunch menu isn't super extensive. But that is definitely not a bad thing for an indecisive person like me. I went with the Birmingham Benny with pork, a biscuit, and white bbq sauce as opposed to the traditional. Very creative concept with a very delicious taste. Absolutely fantastic. And when we were trying to let our kids drink out of the bigger water cups, Kathy brought them ""kids cups"" which were their shot glasses that other kids have enjoyed. Great people, great area and great food. Can't wait for my next trip to The Thirsty Donkey"
The Thirsty Donkey,4,"Quick stop in while waiting for a friend. Vibrant colors and a total beach feel, this place has a great overall vibe. The employees are very nice and engaging. Even if it's your first trip in. They make menu recommendations and tell you about happy hour specials....without having to ask. Emplyees get an A+ (5 Star) review!Food items on the menu were not what I was expecting, they had several seafood selections and claims of the best fish and chips in Birmingham. Downside to the fish and chips, it's only served on Friday and is only available until it runs out. I tried one of their signature drinks, Painkiller, with tropical juice, pusser's rum, and fresh grated nutmeg. Overall taste was good, I'd opt to get it without the nutmeg next time."
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"Back to school blues got you down? Are you dreaming of a vacation in the islands? You are in for a treat because The Thirsty Donkey has brought the island vibe to you, right in the heart of Avondale. From tropical cocktails and a thoughtful menu to an island theme and a fun outdoor patio - this has clearly become the neighborhood hangout (I drive by every day and always see folks here).I've tried the Sloppy Juan (vegan dish). I'm not vegan but it was still delicious but you can also get it with regular chorizo. I've also had the cheeseburger with pimento cheese. Now that's where it's at! I'm looking forward to trying other items (those Coral Bay Sliders look amazing) and especially the brunch menu! Other info:Friday only they serve fish and chips.They serve vegan dishes.The patio is dog friendly.They serve brunch on Sundays.A running group meets here on Thursday nights at 6pm (all paces welcome). You must try Nana's Wine Cake. Hope you check them out!"
The Thirsty Donkey,5,Totally impressed with this place! The staff is super friendly and the food was great. Even on a busy Friday we were immediately seated. We arrived in time for happy hour which is always a plus. I ordered the pain killer to drink and the hubs ordered a margarita.For our meal I ordered the Friday special the Fish n Chips and the hubs ordered The Cajun blackened chicken pasta. We have no complaints. We will definitely return!
The Thirsty Donkey,3,"After hearing about this place from friends for a little while now, we finally decided to give it a try. It is located across from Melt in Avondale, a place which has seen several restaurants come and go. Here's hoping they have more success than some of the previous tenants.The place was PACKED. It had great drinks, some of the strongest ones I've had in Birmingham. I loved the fact that they put the gummy shark that was impaled on the toothpick across my drink. Nice touch there.We ordered a burger and some wings to split. The wings were the smallest wings I have ever had. If that had been my main meal, I would have been very disappointed. The burger was cooked well and helped make up for it. I'm sure we'll be back, but I won't get the wings again."
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"This place has a beachy/ paradise vibe to it.  I visited the Thirsty Donkey on a Tuesday after work to meet up with some friends. We all loved it! So much so that I was so excited to tell my friends/ coworkers about it. As a result of my experience, I was back there  AGAIN on Friday (for lunch) with my friends from work!On my first visit to the Thirsty Donkey , we ordered : jerk dry rub wings ( buffalo dipping sauce) on the side w/t ranch dressing, Cottage Pie and a blackened grouper dish with coconut rice and a mango salsa.  OH and we also ordered a side of French fries!  Everything was delicious!!! Went back for more on Friday for lunch. We ordered: fish and chips , cottage pie, sloppy juan and coral bay sliders.  Everyone enjoyed their food this visit as well! I like The Thirsty Donkey's atmosphere because it's bright , colorful and FUN! The staff made the experience very enjoyable as well!"
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"Approved. Nice to have a new spot to go to in Avondale. I had full intentions of ordering the cheeseburger from looking through yelp photos, but I ordered Norma's cottage pie after waiter recommendation.  It was surprisingly delicious.  For drinks I ordered the mango irmaria which was also delicious and strong. I went with a group of friends and was able to sample some other orders. Fries, sliders, and the wine cake are all good. The patio was nice and staff was friendly. Will be back. The strawberry lemonade cocktail was gross but I let it slide because everything else was good."
The Thirsty Donkey,4,This place seems totally out of place in Avondale but it's also kind of fun to have a fun tropical themed place! The food was pretty good- flavorful but nothing was spicy. I thought the portions were pretty small but not terrible. There are many options on the menu so it's easy to go with a group who are interested in different things. The drinks are fun and everyone who had one loved it! I'd come again but probably not my first choice in Avondale.
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"Vegan Friendly Review: We had just gotten into Birmingham and wanted something new American to eat. I found The Thirsty Donkey via Yelp and it was a great choice. The restaurant has parking  in the front and there is plenty of street parking as well. I went with the Beyond Brat sliders (Vegan) and the wife went with the Drunk Bay Mussels. Everything was made to perfection, the service was outstanding, and we really enjoyed the restaurant's decor. This is a great choice in Birmingham with options for everyone!"
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"GREAT service! Very good biscuit and gravy I had with 2 poached eggs :) my partner had the vegan hash bowl...good, very chili like. Beach vibe interior. The Bloody Mary selection is fun. I had the Kentucky Mary w bourbon. Only cons...plastic cups instead of glasses...and no coffee :/ We'll be back!"
The Thirsty Donkey,4,"I really enjoyed my experience here with a couple of good friends! First off I'm really glad a tropical/carribean themed restaurant has opened up in avondale. It really is a nice touch and adds to the variety of eateries in the location. The spot is very noticeable but just like every eatery in avondale you have to rely on street parking, so keep in mind when it gets very busy. The interior for its small size can be a little roomy and also includes outdoor seating which is a very nice touch. The server we got was very informative and extremely friendly to us as well as the managment. Now what my friends and I ordered were the sloppy Juan, fish and chips, pimento cheese and a order of wings. We also ordered a couple of cocktails they serve too. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and pack full of flavor besides one dish. They also bring the food out in a really quick speed which is very nice. Now the sloppy Juan is a vegan (or sub for pork)chorizo on a vegan roll with loaded guacamole. This sandwich is AMAZING with a little bit of a spicy sweet kick. I highly recommend getting this if you love a sloppy joe but with a slight twist towards it. My friends ordered the fish and chips and wings. The fish and chips were shaped round, it was also flaky and came out steaming hot but was a little small in size and portion. The tartar sauce that was a choice to come with the fish and chips was a great addition but if you dont like tartar sauce they have other options too. Now the wings were very disappointing. You get eight pieces of assorted wings which are marinated, baked then fried. The wings come in six different sauces and were small in size and were very dry. The sauces wasn't flavorful one bit and was just a let down. The cocktails were absolutely on point and enjoyable. We ordered the Irmaria and tuff mule. Irmaria is mixed with light & dark cruzan rum and your choice of coconut, banana, mango or pineapple cruzan topping. Tuff mule is with light rum, lime juice and ginger beer. Both of these drinks are a must and both are highly refreshing. Overall my friends and I had a wonderful time with really great service and really good food (besides the wings) and great refreshing drinks! I highly recommend when the weather cools a bit to sit outside and eat or drink with the nice choice of music. (Edit: the pimento cheese was tasty too! It was one of our favorites and a fan favorite there to enjoy.)"
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"You can not go wrong here!! Every thing we had was extremely excellent!!! Wings! The pie, Caribbean pasta, the drinks!! Everything was excellent! Atmosphere, wait staff!! It's a 5The owner found out we were in town for a Talladega bday trip and brought us Champagne!! I love this place!! Even if he is a Cub fan!!! GO RED BIRDS!!!"
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"Feels like a peice of home(the alabama coast) in the middle of the city. The staff are super friendly and have suggestions for dishes, drinks, and pairings of the two. Great for a quick drink after work or a full sit down dinner. Both at very affordable prices."
The Thirsty Donkey,4,Went with a group of friends everyone really enjoyed their food. I got the pasta + veggies and parmesan it was underwhelming although the ingredients were fresh it was on the bland and boring side. I also ordered the strawberry lemonade which was gross but our server was super nice and switched it out for me which I really appreciated. The service was great and the atmosphere were awesome. 4 stars because everyone else loved there food. I hope to come back and try another vegetarian item on the menu.
The Thirsty Donkey,5,"This is our first time trying this new little restaurant, and man... Good place to eat. I got a lot of food, so hold on for the food review:The wings were jerk rub. I thought they were a little dry and they were tiny wings. I devoured them though. The pimento cheese was to die for. They served it with this crispy, pig skins type chips. They were amazing. And then they served them with lots bread.. if you go here, get the pimento.THE ALLSTAR: the sloppy Juan. Mannn never had a sloppy joe like this... Hands down the only thing you should get here. It's a blend of spicy, sweet, carribean styled chorizo. I'm not a guac fan, but it was a great topping.Fish and chips: delicious. The dang breading is so light and flakey. This is my top fish and chips pick in BHAM.Overall, try this place. I loved it. The atmosphere inside is great. Not to loud, great servers, amazing times on the orders. The drinks are STRONG."
The Thirsty Donkey,4,New addition to the Avondale area. Came in on a Friday evening and we were greeted with friendly staff and seated right away. Pretty simple and straightforward menu. I opted for the margarita and the blackened chicken penne pasta. Both fresh and tasty. I will definitely come back and try some of the other options they have on the menu.
Fancy’s on Fifth,5,"I enjoyed an excellent dining experience here with a friend a few months ago - back when neither of us had ever heard of Covid-19 ;-)We kicked off our meal with a round of drinks (a beer for him, and a Bloody Mary for me) and an order of hush puppies to share.  The former were generously poured and strong, while the latter were excellent (paired with bacon jam and pimento cheese).For our meal we decided to share an El Guapo burger with truffle fries.  Despite the fact that I'm not really a fan of chirizo, the burger was outstanding!  The truffle fries were right on the money as well :-)Service was completely on-point; our server was helpful, friendly and efficient throughout.  My only regret is the fact that we didn't order dessert - I guess we're just going to have to go back one of these days!"
Fancy’s on Fifth,4,"Fancy's is a delight! The atmosphere is great for a fun, group dinner. The drink selection is outstanding, with drinks for any palate. The burgers are great, and the appetizers are delicious (fried green beans)! The only reason I docked a star is the inability to custom build a burger. I selected one from the menu and made so many modifications that it basically became a brand new burger. It would be nice if there was an option to do that on the menu and pay by the topping."
Fancy’s on Fifth,1,"Disappointed us a huge understatement! I've been here before and had some really good food. One of the reasons I suggested coming here, so my fiance could try the food.Now, to be totally fair, our server was actually pretty good, but at the end of the day I'm not paying these prices to make a new friend, I'm looking for a great meal and the service is a bonus. I think the biggest part of the disappointment is we had ribeye at another location locally a week ago for $10 less (Note: Ribeye on the Fancy's menu is listed as Market Price - so you have no idea, unless you ask). We anticipated something that would be comparable to the other one....not even close. First, we were told that the chef was very skilled and cooked steaks to the temperature requested. Well, we requested medium + (basically we just wanted it slightly more than medium...basically we didn't want medium rare. It was brought out and was extremely well done, in fact touch and semi burnt (I think burnt parts were fat). The flavoring that was advertised really didn't add anything to the experience. Fries were exceptionally dry, even though the ribeye was on top of them and very bland. Bottom line, Fancy's should be ashamed to have served this meal at $36. This is something I would have expected to have gotten at a breakfast diner not a place that is somewhat upscale. To be totally fair this review is swayed because of how bad the steak was. The app - Green beans was actually pretty good, even if the dipping sauce was bland (3 - star) and the oysters were pretty good. I'm really disappointed that I suggested coming here for the overall bad food quality and nearly $100 being spent. Highly unlikely I'm going to want to spend that much to return here and hope for an experience that I've had in the past."
Fancy’s on Fifth,5,"I've eaten at Fancy's over the years, but never reviewed it. Expect a wait when you come, but you can go next door to parkside for a drink while you wait. I really love their burgers. They have a great taste and are a very generous portion. Never had a bad meal here. We really enjoyed the crab dip as well for an appetizer. Their drinks are very good as well. I'd happily eat here more often if I lived closer to avondale."
Fancy’s on Fifth,5,This was my first time trying this place out. From my experience most of the restaurants in the Avondale neighborhood is really good. The trend continues with fancy's. The waitress was the first thing that blew me away. The customer service was amazing. Then when I received my steak I knew instantly that I would be coming back to this restaurant. The steak was really good and cooked to perfection. I will be recommending this place  to all of my friends.
Fancy’s on Fifth,5,"I've heard about their burgers for a long time and finally got the chance to try one. I ordered the featured burger: ""The Royale with Cheese."" The three 4 oz. patties were tender and savory, the comeback sauce gave the burger some flare, and the fried egg instantly made everything better.I substituted the kettle chips for truffle fries - if we gonna do it, then do it big! The one thing I would do differently is decrease the saltiness in each of the patties in this particular burger. A burger with one patty would have been fine with the normal saltiness, but three patties leans a little too much on the over-salty side. Regardless - best burger I've had in Birmingham so far."
Fancy’s on Fifth,5,"My friend Grace has been hyping this place up to me for a while and last week, I finally took time to visit them. I must say...this restaurant lived up to the hype. They had great service and great food and drinks. Let me back up a little bit. As we entered, we were promptly seated and our waiter (who was super efficient and helpful the entire time) came by to talk with us. When we told him it was our first time, he gave us some suggestions. He even told us we could still order some of the Happy Hour specials and Happy Hour was about 3-4 minutes to be over. We gave him our drink orders and took a few more minutes to look over the food choices. He came back with our drinks in no time and we ordered our food. Around this time, I noticed the Magic 8 Ball on the table. Of course, I had to try it out a few times. When our food came out (deviled eggs and oysters for me and a burger with fries for my husband), we started chowing down. My food was excellent and my husband really liked the burger. I definitely have been sleeping on this restaurant, but I'm awake now. There's no question of if I'll come back again!"
Fancy’s on Fifth,4,"I finally got around to crossing this place off my list. I have wanted to come here for a while, but something always came up and prevented me from it. The wait is finally over! The vibe is unique and fun. They even have Magic 8 Balls at the table.We started out with some oysters - they offered them raw, fried, or grilled. Ours were good, but they are kinda pricey - $15 for half a dozen. When it came time to decide which burger to get for the main course, I let the Magic 8 Ball decide for me. Needless to say, it did NOT let me down. I got the Strange Brew burger and it was delicious. One of, if not the best, burgers I've had in Birmingham. The truffle fries were good, but I could have used a bit more truffles on my order. We also ordered a mud pie for dessert - it was huge! Much larger than what I was expecting. We'll have another night of dessert on that thing as we took over half of it home.Overall, very happy with finally making it here. I can't wait to come back!"
Fancy’s on Fifth,5,"A great place for a nice date night or celebration. Fancy's is casual but very upscale, you'll see people in jeans and others in cocktail attire on any given night. The food is so damn good. We got raw oysters (always) and it was served with cocktail sauce and extra horseradish, a nice touch. The oysters were all pretty pricey but phenomenal and fresh. We also shared the calamari and the lobster roll. Calamari was crisp and not fishy at all, light and delicious batter. The lobster roll was heavenly, cold chunks of lobster but served with warm clarified butter that really put the cherry on top. With a couple drinks, overall a really amazing meal but you definitely pay fo"
Fancy’s on Fifth,4,Not bad at all. Definitely get the chorizo burger. I tried the Fancy's Greek salad and in my opinion it was great but slightly overpriced.
Fancy’s on Fifth,4,"Friendly, neighborhood place in mildly gentrified part of Birmingham.We took a trip to Birmingham on a whim and were looking for a place to eat and have a few cocktails in a friendly environment.  As it turns out, this place was exactly what we were looking for!They were already busy at 5:30 or so on a Saturday but we were fortunate enough to get in just ahead of the standing-room only crowds.  My wife and I found a spot at the bar and had a good time just chatting with the bartenders and other patrons.  We ordered an appetizer and a couple of entrees and everything was pleasing.It was the friendly staff and the relaxed vibe of this place that made it really enjoyable.  Other patrons were enjoying themselves equally it seemed.  I'd give it 5-stars but that might be over-the-top.  Four is respectable and I'd definitely go back."
Fancy’s on Fifth,5,"Every meal I've had at Fancy's has been outstanding!  The team is always incredibly knowledgeable about how to modify the dishes to be vegan.  Plus, the Beyond patty and vegan cheese make it easy to get creative with Fancy's signature burgers."
Fancy’s on Fifth,5,Great place for burgers! We randomly found this restaurant and I'm glad we did because it quickly became one of our favorites! The atmosphere is awesome and the food is insanely good. Neither of us eats seafood so it was a total burger night. Their burgers are super tasty and the fries were cooked to perfection. They also offer complimentary valet which makes the experience even better. We will definitely be coming back!
Fancy’s on Fifth,5,"I thought I had already written a review, but just realized I hadn't. I love their veggie burgers. Really good! Fries are good too! Location is nice and trendy. It's in the heart of Avondale. The outdoor area is nice as well as the inside. I will definitely be back!"
Fancy’s on Fifth,3,"This is honestly a super cute spot, it's honestly quite debatable if I would come back here's why:When we got there it was at around 8:30 on a weeknight so it wasn't too busy and the crowd was beginning to thin out. We were sat pretty quick and our service was super quick as well! The drink menu is bigger than the food menu and from my understanding I totally thought it was more of a restaurant than a bar type deal. So I was a little mislead in that sense. To the menu, it was very limited I thought it was going to be more seafood than red meat but I was sadly mistaken. I ordered the Cacio Pasta and it came out cold :( it has the potential to be pretty good but just lacked the flavor I was looking for. The best thing we had that night was the Crab Dip! Please don't go here without trying the dip it was awesome! Other than that the drinks were perfect if I do come back I will come for the Crab Dip and a few drinks with friends. Overall, I had a pretty great experience here!"
Fancy’s on Fifth,3,"I'm not a raw oyster consumer at all. Ask anyone that has been to a Yelp event with me where they served oysters lol. It's in the heart of Avondale, so expect street parking. I came in here on a weeknight and there was a small wait to get a table. Maybe 10 minutes. I had studied the menu and pictures on Yelp long and hard before and pretty much knew what I wanted to order. Shout out to these wonderful photographers! The server came by my table a few times then ended up switching to a different server cause apparently his shift was ending soon. The next server was super sweet and friendly. I ended up getting the Royale with cheese with chips on the side. I had chosen it based on Ava's picture she posted. Looked like it huge slice of bacon on a toasted piece of bread. My food didn't come out quite as spectacular as hers though. I think they changed the menu up some. I was given a circular hamburger bun and bacon jam instead of the huge strip of bacon I wanted. Looking back at their all menus other yelpers posted, it seems they change things up fairly often too. I saw a picture of a nice salad I wanted but couldn't find on the menu either. Oh well. I remember being a kid and my parents driving past this place when it was an antique store selling mostly super heavy vases and pots that no one ever bought nor needed. Great to see them turn it into something like this though!"
Fancy’s on Fifth,5,"We came here around 7:30 on a Saturday night and were sat about 45 minutes later. There's a walk-up window for bar service while you wait, and I enjoyed the Featured Margarita (pictured - with rose, hibiscus, and honeysuckle) while waiting. We both ordered the Flaming Lips burger with truffle fries and an extra jalapeno ranch to dip the fries in. The atmosphere was busy but still gave an intimate dinner vibe for us, although there were plenty of large groups."
Fancy’s on Fifth,4,"Ribeye steak and fries was good, my server brought me out two white sauces for dipping (smoked mayo and champagne ranch). This made eating the fries an, ""out of the world experience"", and made up for steak that while good lacked depth and marbling.  The price felt adequate and some good beer options.  The staff was friendly, kind, and attentive which helped to change a 3 star into a 4 star."
Fancy’s on Fifth,4,"We have passed this place a few times and decided to go in seeing as they had Oysters.  We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and appetizers.  We got the Five Cheese Crab Dip and Deviled Eggs.  Both which were yummy!! They make their own garlic bread to dip into the crab dip!  We went to order and were told they were out of Oysters that day. Not sure why. We were a tad disappointed, but found something else to order.  I got a house salad and my husband got the fish and chips.  Both items were yummy!  The service of the staff was great! They were friendly and the service was good.  I would like to return to try their oysters sometime. :) If you haven't been there I would definitely recommend."
Fancy’s on Fifth,4,"Ribeye steak With Fancy's Fries and the back plate is the El Guapo burger. The El Guapo was delicious, totally worth it.The Steak on the other hand in my opinion was not worth it for the price, I paid about 36 for the steak since its market priced. Not as tender and juicy as I would have liked it, somewhat chewy. The in house steaksauce they make is a great compliment and added alot of flavor to the steak, otherwise the steak itself tasted decent."
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,"Coming back to review an old favorite...I always enjoy Hattie B's. I've tried several things on the menu, but my go-to order is the chicken tenders, medium, with fries and the DELICIOUS pimento mac 'n cheese. Their banana pudding and chicken and waffles are also really good. I've dined in several times and service is always good, and they are usually pretty quick even when they have really long lines. I've ordered takeout from them as well and the food does hold up well. The order portions are very large - I can rarely finish a meal, but the food does heat up pretty well later. Definitely a consistent favorite!"
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,I want to say  y'all have the Best chicken in Bham. I had the tenders and they were amazing and the seasoning on them was amazing and the fries were great. Also the peach cobbler was amazing along with the ice cream. I did a review on my YouTube channel called Tmac Eats but it got taken down because of the music you guys were playing in your restaurant. That's ok lol YouTube channel link youtube.com/channel/UClQ…Here's Apia of the taken down vid
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,"You can't go wrong with Hattie B's.This was my first time in a location outside of Nashville but it lived up to my expectation. I was surprised at how completely dead the place was for 8pm but maybe it's more of a lunch spot?If you haven't had Hattie B's, this is a must stop."
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,"After living in Birmingham for years, it was time to try Hattie B's. I've heard things like it's overrated or just ok, but I couldn't disagree more. They have some of the best fried chicken ever! Getting up to the counter, the employee asked if we had ever been there before. After saying no, he asked us white or dark meat and how spicy? Based on my answers, he recommended the small dark plate medium with fries and mac n cheese. He was very friendly and super helpful!The food took less than 10 minutes to be brought to our table. I think it's a great value to get a wing and thigh with two sides for under $10. I couldn't possibly finish the whole thing but it was amazing. The chicken was tender and moist with a crunchy fry. The medium has just the right amount of spice to not be overwhelming, but give it good flavor. The fries were good but the kickback sauce makes them great! The mac n cheese was very creamy but good. My friend got shut the cluck up, the hottest sauce, as a challenge. Even if you love super spicy food, I do not recommend this! He ate his meal but was refilling his water constantly and ate a lot less than he normally does. Stick with the sauces below it!Overall we had a great experience at Hattie B's and we will definitely be back!"
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,"Finally got a chance to try Hattie B's! I went with the chicken tenders, fries and pimento Mac and cheese! The tenders are HUGE. I probably could have split my meal with a friend there was so much. But all of it was delicious. I'm kinda weak when it comes to spicy, so I ordered my tenders with the medium sauce, but I kinda regretted it because it wasn't spicy enough. I needed that KICK. The Mac and cheese was everything. Creamy, flavorful and tasty. And the fries were crispy and salty. Love it all. Now I need Hattie B's to come to Orlando!"
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,4,"I really like Hattie B's. I'll admit it took me way too long to get here and try it, but glad I finally did this year. The concept is simple and the menu is very straightforward-order at the counter and they'll bring it out to you. My wife and I both settled each with getting the 3 jumbo tenders and several sides splitting potato salad, Mac and cheese, greens, and slaw. The chicken was delicious and of course had a kick to it, but we didn't overdo it with the breading since it was our first time so we did mild and I really liked it. Very flavorful.  The sides were ok, but my favorite was the Mac and cheese; the pimento was nice in it. It was a nice day out, so we enjoyed the patio and it didn't take too long for our food to come out. I'll be back for sure."
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,Love it! Eat here almost every month . The all white mild seasoning with Mac and cheese and baked beans are the bomb!
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,4,"Been wanting to try since they opened. So when a co-worker decided to pick up from there for lunch, I couldn't resist.I decided to go with what I thought would be safe and chose the Medium level for my Fried Jumbo Tenders with a side of Pimento Mac & Cheese and Creamy Cole Slaw.First off the meal traveled very well, so kudos to the packaging.The ""Jumbo"" tenders were truly jumbo sized and could easily see splitting it into 2 meals, especially if you add a 3rd side for $1. I always start with the medium for hot or buffalo chicken at a new place. While it was just enough heat, I think I will try Hot next time and there most definitely will be a next time. The heat was more of an after affect than an in your face at first bite.While I liked both sides, the Pimento Mac & Cheese was absolutely the walking dog and as good as advertised from recommendations. The Creamy Cole Slaw was pretty good but not the best I have ever had.I still want to dine in but not opposed to a repeat take out run."
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,"Are you kidding? This place was great! Recommended by a friend so we decided to stop in since it was close and was cold out( in the 30's). Got in and what a warm atmosphere! I mean the staff was very nice friendly and talkative. Ask what they recommend and after they ask us a few questions they made a few recommendations. We went with them and we were more than satisfied. That fried chicken though! Bomb! No, really bomb! Juice, flavorful, ok I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it. Seemed like a bunch of college kids eating here just chilling and enjoying the music and their friends. It felt like everyone felt at home inside. I think it was because of the music and the atmosphere created by the employees. Collard greens and mac and cheese were good too! Oh, wait, that peach cobbler, go for just that and you'll understand my post! Bomb! Great place! Now, open up in California cause I do t think I'll be back in Alabama anytime soon!"
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,4,"Stopped on our way home to Louisiana from Tennessee. Overall, I thought it was pretty good. Not on the level of Gus's or Uncle Lou's, but pretty good. We ordered the regular hot and I didn't find it to be too spicy, pretty much the perfect level of spice. The sides (mac n cheese, greens) were ok but nothing to write home about."
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,"We got Hattie B's to go and while I'm always nervous about to go orders, Hattie B's did not disappoint!! Everything was fantastic! From the presentation, the temperature, the taste, it was all great. Their cobbler and pimento Mac n cheese are to die for!! Their chicken was also a game changer. I will be returning for sure!"
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,"I have been to Hattie B's a few times and now reviewing them. I have to say this is not your typical fast food fried chicken you will get elsewhere.Chicken has always been on point full of intense flavor, very juicy, and the breading is always crisp to perfection. I have ordered both Hot and Damn hot, depending on the mood I am on, to take on the heat. However, I have not come to senses in trying to the ""shut the cluck up"" hotness. Anyway you choose, you will not be disappointed.As for the sides I absolutely savor their red skin potato salad, creamy coleslaw, and greens.The Peach cobbler when in season is a must try, especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, is the perfect combination.This is my go to when craving fried chicken!!"
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,"Incredible customer service and the food is amazing.  It was my first time and everyone was so helpful - inviting me to try a sample, making great suggestions, etc.  I had the chicken sandwich, which was a great combination of flavors !  The medium had the right about is heat !  The pimento Mac/ cheese is a must.  Plenty of local beers on draft.  Come one by and support this nice addition to b'ham !!"
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,3,"I ordered Small Dark with medium heat, and sides of collard greens and potato salad. The leg and thigh were large and still connected together as one piece. It was fried-to-order so was piping hot. and that was a plus. The medium spices gave the batter an orangish tone, and it was spicy. The chicken was glistening in oil and served on a slice of toast that helped absorb the grease. Aside from the greasiness, the chicken was okay. The Comeback dipping sauce was a creamy mayo base that was just okay. I probably would not come back for it.My side choices were  just okay. The potato salad was pretty average. It lacked any red skin that would have given it some character. The greens were cooked down and tender. But, without vinegar seasoning they were pretty flavorless.I understand Hattie B is popular, but I was not impressed.  Greasy fried chicken, mediocre dipping sauce, and bland sides. Sorry, I don't see what all the fuss is about."
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,"Having lived in Nashville for most of my life, you have to credit some of the original hot chicken places like Prince's Hot Chicken or Bolton's for the expansion of the category! With that in mind, Hattie B's in Birmingham brings the some of the consistency of hot chicken that you can find in Nashville. The quality of the Nashville Hattie B's and Birmingham Hattie B's does not change. Birmingham has come delicious hot chicken locations but my selling point of Hattie B's is the hearty sides that you can pair with the chicken. If you go, you need to experience the brilliant pain of ""Damn Hot"" or ""Shut the Cluck Up"" spice level choices. Do it the right way when you go!"
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,3,"I love fried chicken. I love spicy food. So, I really wanted to try this place. Well, I'm glad I did, but I probably won't be back because there are other places that has better food. I ordered the breast and wing plate, medium spice, with greens and pimento Mac and cheese. The chicken was so greasy. The spice was on the skin so if u don't eat the greasy skin, then the rest of the chicken meat has no flavor. The greens were bland. The Mac and cheese was good but too runny for me. Service was fine. The atmosphere was great. We sat on the deck outside and could see the action from the bars/restaurants across the street."
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,4,"The food at Hattie B's is always a hit. We weren't too hungry by the time lunch hit, but we still wanted hot chicken. So, we got the 3 tender meal, but added on an extra wing ($2) and extra side ($1). The medium wasn't actually that hot, so next time I'll be going with hot. For sides, we got the mac and cheese (to die for), fries (very very good), and collard greens (very eh, but got the veggies in). What makes everything really good is the comeback sauce. I usually get 2 of them, and it makes my tummy really happy.One downside to this location is the line during lunch gets SO long. We were waiting there for such a long time before another register opened. However, they do let dogs on the patio, which really improved our road trip experience!"
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,4,"I have been itching to get to Hattie's! I've heard so much about this restaurant! I finally made it there today! The staff was amazing! I ordered the medium chicken tenders with a side of the pimento Mac and cheese(to die for) and some crinkle cut fries. To wash it all down, I enjoyed a nice strawberry cider(blew my socks off!) I enjoyed the tenders, but a little different for me. I've never had hot chicken! It was really delicious! However, next time, I'd rather have it without the sauce. The fries were crispy and yummy(especially dipped in ranch) and the pimento Mac and cheese????? TOO AMAZING FOR TV. I'm definitely coming back here. The weather was nice enough for the patio. Great view!"
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,4,First time at this joint after hearing several good things about it. I kinda struggle with spicy foods so I was a bit hesitant about ordering the mild instead of the completely spice free one but the dude who took my order said it really isn't bad. Ok he was kinda wrong because it was almost spicy to the point where it was unpleasant to eat and lost any type of flavor besides pure spice if that makes any sense. The pimento Mac and cheese was good but the portion was small and I treated it as a distraction from the spicy chicken. Now you might be wondering why am I still giving four stars? The chicken was cooked well which isn't always the case at a lotta places. I did enjoy the pickle and the overall atmosphere of the place. Will probably be back to try something else (probably the tenders) with an assortment of sauces because that seemed to be popular.
Hattie B’s Hot Chicken - Bham,5,"I remember when I used to be a boy real green behind the gills about spice I'd shake my head at even a dash of pepper on my plate, but like a virgin I've never been the same since Hattinald B's wore out my insides. Also just like my virginity, I was crying the whole time I was eating Hattinald's Shut the Cluck Up Sandwish. Even when I tried to save to save myself from Hattinald's signature heat with a swig of water, it felt like it burned worse. Thank you Mr. B, for opening my eyes to the joys of earth's heat. Like my sweet virgin hole felt, my mouth felt used and wanting for more. Me and my holes are open and waiting for the day YOURE open Mr. B."
Watkins Branch,5,"I have been a fan of JP's work for many years at Fig Tree Cafe. So I was REALLY excited to hear he was opening a place closer to me in Mountain Brook Village. It is extremely unfortunate the timing of his opening of this place. Because I know the food in house would be that much better than it is to-go. But during this time, they are doing curbside and making it really easy to get delicious food while distancing.Again, I really hate I did not make it in here before everything was shut down. I did not go to the previous business that was in this location. But from the safe distance of my car, it looks like a small dining area with possibly some great outdoor sections just out back? But again, just an observation from my driver's seat.We decided to test out their French style wings, burger and some of the fried green tomatoes. The tomatoes were probably our least favorite. And that is mainly because it was forced to steam in a to-go container. I have had JPs FGTs before and I know they would have been great in house. The burger and the wings were really good!! But the real star of the show were those truffle fries. No skimping on the truffle. And they did surprisingly well in a to-go container.As soon as we are able, we will be checking this place out in person. But for our Covid-19 curbside delivery experience, I couldn't possibly give less than five stars."
Watkins Branch,5,"Huge fan of Watkins Branch (and their sister, Fig Tree). The service is impeccable and the space is adorable. Love the food, love the drinks. Excited to have them in BHM! Grabbed takeout a few times during quarantine, and it was excellent, too!"
Watkins Branch,5,"Not long ago, I was leaving the Greenwise grocery store location in Mountain Brook and peeked a Watkin's Branch logo. I drove by the building and immediately put it on my list, as it was a sister location of the great Fig Tree restaurant. Fast forward a month or so and myself and a few other guests needed a dinner spot and this was the place to go. Upon entering we were seated and felt right in place. We had an extremely inviting employee that seated us and continued to serve us through the dinner. As young adults we were less about the the amazing bourbon/rye pour's they offered and more about the affordable and delicious cocktails/beer selections they had. One of us had a cocktail with in house grenadine that was delicious. I had a IPA that I had not previously had that was priced very reasonable and great. The food was beyond enjoyable. We got multiple small plates and were treated to one of the best pork belly dishes I had ever eaten. Everything about the location, service, and meal was delightful. While I'm young and still working to maintain frugality these kinds of meals are worth it. I will be back and excited for the people in the area to have this place."
Watkins Branch,5,"Great locally owned restaurant. I would give the alcohol and a staff that cares 5 stars. The food is good, the scallops have a crab bisque sauce that is very tasty, and I had the burger medium and really enjoyed it. The fries were just OK. The crab cake was VERY good. I would give the food overall 4 stars. 4.5 total rounds up to 5. All in all, a great place."
Watkins Branch,5,"This place is absolutely fantastic. Have spent the last few years living in NYC, this reminds me of a place in Soho or West Village you pop in for a drink that has fantastic food. Highly recommend. Anything from their menu has been great. Their cocktail that is similar to an Old Fashion is spectacular, also the Anne's Folles is incredible. You won't be disappointed."
Watkins Branch,5,Great place for dinner looking at the menu the cocktails were phenomenal!! Can't wait to go try the food!! Atmosphere is great!! The ambiance was was great!!
Watkins Branch,5,"Great new addition to Mountain Brook! Watkins Branch is in the old Icehouse location down from Another Broken Egg and Sneaky Pete's. It's by the same owners as Fig Tree and has a bourbon brasserie theme. I stopped by for a drink tonight but I will definitely be back to try the food. The actual location is fairly small, there are 4-5 2 and 4 tops along the left wall with the only indoor seating being bar seating. There is a nice outdoor area as well with couches and a fire pit. I had a classic old fashioned (not on their cocktail menu, but they will make it for you no problem) with their house whiskey, old forester 86. It was classic, simple, and delicious. I would've loved a big ice cube, but other than that, no complaints. The staff was very attentive and friendly. While I didn't try the food this visit, the menu includes items like crab cake, fried green tomatoes, a salami and cheese sandiwich and roasted duck. It's a limited menu with only about 4-5 entrees and small plates, but it all sounded so good. Only other downside is when the tables were full and 4 people were sitting at the bar, the small room got fairly noisy, but that's to be expected in a packed, smaller venue. Can't wait to return to try some more of their cocktails and food!"
Watkins Branch,5,"Really enjoyed being at the grand opening of this new bistro! The owner also owns The Fig Tree restaurant as well. Fantastic food! The people sitting next to me were absolutely raving over the tuna!  I went with the fried green tomatoes which were absolutely scrumptious! So happy I went! It's small on the inside but has a real clean style happening. Old bourbon, single malt scotch, whiskey, and not the usual stuff that everyone has. A real connoisseur's collection of spirits here! Enjoy everyone!"
Watkins Branch,1,"I wanted to love this place - really!! I LOVE The Fig Tree - gave them 5 stars - they knocked our socks off!Here, not so much. I had a burger. The meat was super tender and cooked perfectly. After several bites, I got the salt!! And so much of it that it made it almost inedible (I was too far into the burger to send it back, but I should have). I suspect the chef is a smoker - this is usually the case when food is severely over salted. Also, the layout of this place is odd. Too many tables right near the bathroom. I do not really want to hear the sounds of what goes on in a bathroom while I am trying to eat. I was also surprised that there were no salads on the menu - my fault for not checking ahead of time. The fries that are shown in the pictures are not the fries that I got on my plate. Mine looked like run of the mill Sysco style. I likely will not be returning."
Watkins Branch,5,Awesome place! Love to come in and talk to the friendly staff and try some great food.
Watkins Branch,5,Stopped in on a whim from out of town. The food was great...the staff was welcoming and entertaining. Had an amazing meal and an amazing time.
Watkins Branch,5,"This is a great new addition to Mountain Brook! They have an amazing chef, a wonderful bartender, and a great atmosphere. I started the night with a Blackberry Bramble, a seasonally crafted cocktail. You better get yours while you can! I also had the elk burger, which was cooked to perfection and full of flavor."
Watkins Branch,5,"Was amazed I hadn't heard of this tiny place sooner... Hidden away in a spot that will be a great location in the near future (Mountain Brook Village construction) this delightful place wowed me with their food, cocktails, and service. I had the regular burger and can't wait to try the bison burger because both seem delicious. I don't always finish a restaurant burger but I was wiping up the plate with my fries. Perfectly cooked, very salty and juicy, delicious fresh toppings. And the cocktails aren't just your predictable whiskey bar drinks, with a few nods to old timey prohibition recipes and unexpected combinations. This place gives me slight consolation for the tragic closing of Avo /Dram in the area! Going back here soon."
Watkins Branch,5,"Cool vibe, friendly staff and excellent food. My husband proclaimed that their hamburger is the BEST he's ever had! Thank you to GM, Justin and bartender, Patrick for a great dining experience. We'll definitely be back (regularly)."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,4,"I made my own salad from here for delivery through Waitr. Was pleasantly surprised at how large the size was for the price. It was easily two servings or more. They had a large selection for proteins, veggies, cheeses, and dressings.I got the soup of the day and it was a broccoli soup (had broccoli in it, anyway). It was super yummy and a large portion. The only real issue I had with the order was just the coffee. I just ordered a black medium coffee, but I didn't realize they sold Starbucks coffee. Was unpleasantly surprised when the Waitr delivery guy showed up with a coffee I chucked in the trash. Blech.... Hate Starbucks. Otherwise, the food was well-priced with hearty portions and fresh. Would definitely order from again, as long as it's not for coffee."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,5,"I rarely go downtown, but saw this restaurant after I left Wale concert. It was so pretty from the outside. I had never heard of it, so I thought that this would be a good location to have our January's ladies night. I called to see if they could sit large parties and if they have a happy hour. They were so nice on the phone, and was happy to accommodate my party. The day of the ladies night, I was looking for parking. I didn't realize that the restaurant was in the hotel. I asked the valet where did we need to park. He was very courteous and gave us the option of parking in a free parking lot next to the hotel or we could pay and park in the hotel's deck. Of course we chose free. We walked into the hotel and was awe struck at how beautiful it was. We took the stairs down to the restaurant so that we could take in the beautiful decorations. The hotel has a beautiful chandelier. When you walk down the steps they have a lounge area. The building is very pretty and you can take really good pictures (hint hint for the selfie lovers). As we entered into the restaurant, we were greeted by the sweetest hostess. She was looking forward to our party arriving. They were having a cooking class, which interested me. She begin to explain all the different classes that they offer. I will be signing up for one of those classes. Christian our waiter walked us to our table. He was very kind and knowledgeable of the items on the menu. He suggested that a good drink to try was the blazer. This drink was not what I expected. It was so pretty. I was excited of how the drink was displayed. I had just seen a drink similar to this online being served at a restaurant in ATL, and wanted to try one. I couldn't believe that we had a restaurant here that served it. The drink was a bluish green and it started to smoke. It was very good, sweet but strong. We sat by the bar and the bar tender was very sweet. For dinner I got the burger and fries. The burger was seasoned to perfection. It came with wickles (sweet and hot pickles). Their fries are really good and their ranch tastes as if it was homemade. I really enjoyed myself. The decor of the restaurant is very nice. They have long hardwood tables with outlets that you can charge your phone while you are eating. I highly recommend that you give them a try."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,5,"I have nothing but good things to say about this spot. It is a Bham gem that's hidden in plain sight.  Its located within the Hilton on the Southside. The ambiance here is very quaint and a bit romantic. As a May baby, I loved the emerald green decor.  We came here for a ladies night.  Although only 4 of us showed, we were all impressed with everything.  Our waiter Christian was soooo nice and helpful.  He explained everything to us, offered recommendations and just made us feel so welcomed. I first tried the Blazer cocktail.  It came separate for Christian to blend like a science experiment (hence THE LAB). It was strong and tasty... if you are a lightweight, tread lightly.  For dinner, I ordered the catfish sandwich. It was a great choice. The catfish could've had just a little more flavor but was cooked crunchy and flaky. The other ladies really enjoyed their food. Honestly, I was so into my meal and taken by the blazer that I don't remember what they had to eat. (facepalm) I loved how the drinks were all like a concoction tho... really cool.  One of the ladies got a drink that was put into a smoker! So interesting! I look forward to coming back here... they offer happy hour M-F... I plan to give that a try!"
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,4,Went to the Lab for a Sunday brunch. It was four people in our party. We met around 11:30. We were the only ones there. I ordered the duck w greens. It came with corn grits but I had to send the grits back. There was no flavor.Others in my party returned their grits too. For the good part.... the duck was delicious. Moist and seasoned well. The greens were tasty. Portion size was good for brunch. Management exchanged my grits for a salad. Very accommodating.
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,4,"I've been to the Lab several times, and as a UAB employee, the location is super convenient and saving 20% on my meal with my employee badge is always a plus! I love that parking is super convenient when I'm meeting non-UAB people for lunch. They can park in the deck for free with validation! You can't get that anywhere else in Bham! And to the food! I like the Lab Burger... those spicy pickles are the best! And those fries are to die for! I've also enjoyed the pork skins and pimento/cheese.... just be careful because it can be bubbling hot and will burn your mouth if you're not careful! The one negative about the Lab is the wait. Whenever I've been (early and peak times), the wait times for food/service are a little too long. Especially for lunch when folks have an hour... it shouldn't take that long to take orders/being out food. I usually ask for my bill as soon as they drop off food, so thAts a little less time that I have to wait. Overall, a good dining option near UAB!"
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,2,"Second visit here. I tried the spicy peach something that was the drink of the day. It had absolutely no alcohol in it. I asked the bartender what alcohol was supposed to be in it and she said she ""think"" it was tequila but SHE made it. So I wanna know how she's making drinks and don't know what she's using. I tried the happy hour jalapeño cornbread bites with honey butter. They came out hard, dry and with a butter full of pecans apparently. I asked what was in the butter after I took a bite and was told by the same bartender she didn't know and a male manager came over and said I think they added pecans to the butter and did I have a allergy. Omfg. If I did I'd been on the floor already. The menu didn't say nuts were in it which is why I ordered. 10 minutes later I was brought melted butter and cold butter for now cold nasty bites. I was still struggling to get the pecans outta my braces so I just wanted no parts of that anymore. A manager took them off for me and totally understood how bad they could have been. Because my friend had the Mushroom Chevere Bucatini pasta in her restaurant week pic and it was tasty I ordered my own bowl. It finally comes and it looks amazing but definitely lacked flavor. I added a pretty good amount of salt and pepper to get through the meal. My friend decided to do the restaurant week special. She chose fried green tomatoes and the should season the batter hands down. U can NOT serve fried green tomatoes in Alabama in unseasoned flour. It's a sin. She did the same to her pasta. Added salt and pepperThe peach tart dessert we shared. It's a damn hard biscuit with cooked peaches on top. Nothing grilled. Nothing compote. Just wasn't pleasing.This was her first time here and the menu is what made her pick the place. She'd definitely not return and I doubt I will either. The menu reads wonderfully and you expect a helluva experience from reading it. But their execution of these menu items desperately needs some work. I don't know if they need to simplify the menu or just simply get a better Chef."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,3,"Came here for restaurant week since we liked the menu and I had wanted to try this anyway. We tried the pimento cheese and pork rinds for an appetizer and the skillet corn bread. The pork rinds were very good and they gave you a lot of them. Pork rinds are not my thing and the fact that I ate more than one says a lot. It was interesting dipping them in the pimento cheese. I'm glad I tried it and recommend it if you are wanting to try something different. The skillet corn bread was pretty good and the honey pecan butter was awesome. For my entree, I got the pork tacos. They were really good. The only thing I didn't like is that they were corn tortillas instead of flour but I just ate the insides and left the tortillas. For dessert we got the blackberry cobbler. This was really disappointing as it was more like blackberry soup. Very little cobbler and was served so hot that the ice cream that was put on top was completely melted by the time it hit our table. Despite the fact that they weren't that busy our food took forever. So, a mixed review here. Didn't hate it, didn't love it."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,4,"Came here with a group of about 12 and we sat in the curtained off private room. It was quite nice and we had 3 wait staff along with the chef checking on us regularly. We ordered so many things off the menu I felt like we had a sample of everything. I will outline what I felt like was good and what was alright below. Overall, I give the service and environment a solid 5 and the food a very solid 4. Things that really popped out for me were the tuna with the crispy chips made from taro plant. Marinated and soaked for a while, the tuna itself was very good. The larger fish dish we had though, wasn't so great. We all felt like that fish was a little too salty citrusy and everything on it just kind of added to that. The crab cakes were mini and delightful. And something I thought I wouldn't like I loved! The mushroom pizza! I'm usually a meat lover so I thought I'd like the meat pizza more but the mushroom pizza was so underrated! One of the last things I wanted to mention was the samplers appetizer dish. The dish had a lot going on and I liked about half of the things on the dish. I had never had cheese and honey before and I have to say you have to give it a shot! But, it had so much going on that it felt a little disappointing to have half a dish of stuff you don't like. Oh yeah and the tacos were fire so give those a shot!Going to come back for lunch sometime and give it another shot!"
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,5,"Downstairs in the Hilton UAB. Awesome environment and great servers. Everyone is kind and the food is delicious. Had the catfish tacos and it was crisp, tasty, and presentable. Was a little late on the fries but that's fine with me as long as I had my catfish tacos at a reasonable time. Military discount included! Didn't even ask for it. Awesome. Hotel is also amazing. Don't want to stay to close to the airport then just stay at the Hiltons at UAB. Thank you."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,4,"We went to The Lab Bar & Kitchen for Mother's Day, which I thought was unconventional, but ended up being really good! The manager said it was their first time doing Mother's Day brunch and I am glad they did! We started with mimosas, of course! Mom's favorite. I got the pork medallions on top of grits and it was delicious. My mom got the filet (painfully undercooked) with fantastic roasted potatoes and sunny side up eggs. She loved it so I would call it a success! Thanks guys! We will definitely be back."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,3,"We met here for a post-protest round of beers and flatbreads, and burgers for the truly hungry.  Whole beer prices were crazy - $5 for a Coors Light - food prices were reasonable and the food was quite good.   One in our group had the Blazer Burger and liked it quite well.  The addition of sweet with spicy made the flavor unique.  The burger was large enough to satisfy, and the potatoes that came with it were really very good.  Sort of potato wedges, crispy outside and creamy inside, and nice and hot.  The two flatbreads were good - one with pork and the other more like a sausage and pepperoni pizza, but both were tasty.  Located in the bottom floor of the UAB Sheraton, It's a beautiful place, looks swanky, so the casual food belies the appearance of the place.  All in all, a decent dining experience."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,5,"LET'S take a moment to worship this divine Crispy Chicken plate here at The Lab Bar here in Beautiful Birmingham, Alabama. The Lab Bar and Kitchen is located on the corner of 20th St S and University Boulevard. I have again discovered a jewel in the wake of hunger in The Magic City! Here we have the south all in one plate! A cutlet of chicken breast gently fried to an awesome texture over a bed of corn emulsion(sweet corn), savory fried grits, tobacco onions, collard greens and Demi glaze. The flavors are meant to be in this plate, warm and nostalgic. This plate smells just like grandma's kitchen. I paired my dish with a glass of Bordeaux wine and it's the perfect robust red with a bit of spice. Two thumbs up! I am so happy to be back! Took a hiatus to finish school, but back better than ever. EAT The Lab Bar and Kitchen Brought to you by an @ipushfoodie by way of @ipushmagazine"
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,4,"Came here for a UAB function the other day that had part of the proceeds going to a local charity - a nice thing for them in which to partake.The wait staff was great, constantly checking on us throughout the night. The appetizers were good, but definitely make sure which section you are ordering from - the small plates (1-2 people) or big plates (table sized). They were all great, but several of them left me wanting more since it was a smaller portion. The drinks were decent - esp the blazer. The Blazer is a green drink in a flute shaped glass which literally has smoke coming out of it throughout, which is both a different experience, and a nice visual for UAB fans. I ordered the buccatini pasta, which was very tasty. It might have used a tad more salt, but overall, was very flavorful.I'm sure we'll be back soon!"
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,3,"Overall, was an underwhelming experience. I stopped in on a weeknight while in town for a conference. We started with the jalapeño cornbread bites which were just ok, definitely on the dry side. IMO, cornbread should be a little sweet and buttery, neither of which they were. For entrees, my colleagues both got the pulled pork tacos and I got the shrimp and grits. I tried the tacos and was not impressed, I think the pulled pork would've been better served as a traditional sandwich with some slaw. They missed on the taco part. And my entree left much to be desired - the grits were basically one solid piece, like they had been sitting under the lamp for way too long. The shrimp was over cooked and basically hard. We did end up ordering dessert because they all sounded so tasty. We got the butter cake, which the presentation of was very interesting - the cake came in a mason jar with a toasted marshmallow topping. Def didn't need the marshmallow, it's already really sweet and dense on its own. I did enjoy the caramelized banana and graham cracker brittle that came along. I would've been totally happy with those alone without the cake!The service was very good, but reaaaally slow. We sat for over two hours, and not by choice. The food was very slow to come out.And should I mention that something did not agree with me and I was sick the next morning."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,2,"I will start this out as saying we wanted to try this place during restaurant week for the sole reason of the blackberry cobbler. Since this was our first time here we did make reservations, which was absolutely useless as there were only about 6 table with people in them. We use open table for 2 reasons, one it is easy to book and you get points making reservations... having said that the waiter never acknowledged our reservations but at least we still got the points. Now on the the next issue.... our waiter was for the lack of a better phrase... not very attentive. So the first decision was the drinks for the evening. I ordered the very sweet tea, which does not taste anything like a sweet tea nor did it taste like a Long Island iced tea. So on to ordering, since this was restaurant week we pretty much knew what we were ordering. I ordered the pimento cheese and pork rinds for my app, the lab burger for my mane and of course the blackberry cobbler that we have been waiting for... so we order and at that time my wife orders a mixed drink. While waiting for her drink another waitress sat a couple beside us. The reason this is relevant will be know shortly. After about 10 minutes the drink finally arrives. Now mind you the table beside us had already received there drinks and have now ordered. Now we are into about 30 minutes after we ordered and abut 15 for the table next to us. Then we see what we thought was our meal come out of the kitchen. Oh no, the pork tacos that my wife thought were hers was for the table next to us... yep the ones that were sat after us. Ok at this point I am getting a little peeved. Finally 15 minutes after the table beside us got their food ours finally arrives... the chip fries with my burger were very tasty, warm but not hot.... probably sat under a heating lamp for awhile. The lab burger.... was the worst burger I have ever eaten.... it had a very off flavor to it, I could not pinpoint exactly what it was.... but is was horrid. I barely got 3 bites before throwing in the towel. So now we are at the point the desert should be coming out.. of course our waiter was no where to be seen. I ask a waitress to get our server so we could get desert and the check. The waiter finally comes out and states the kitchen made a mistake and gave away one of the cobblers to another table.. we said fine bring out the one they still had made... after minutes after we asked for the cobbler and check the waiter brings out 2 what looked to be Ike desert dishes with a blackberry soup in it. Yes you heard me right, soup.... the only crust so to speak was in the middle of this mess.. and that crust was extremely hard, Like concrete hard. We both tried to eat it, but only got about half way into it. The only thing good about this desert was the ice cream on top. So for a business to participate in restaurant week they should have been on their A game. This was not the case when we went there. A very disappointing meal for date night.The only plus for the night was the wife's pork tacos, she really liked them. It would be nice though if you gave your customers a choice between corn and wheat taco shells. For me I probably won't be back, the mere thought of that really bad tasting burger was enough to put me off for a long while.."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,3,"A cool new addition to Birmingham located in the Hilton. I came here on a Saturday night with friends for dinner after the place recently opened.The positives: a spacious modern layout with a good bit of seating and a bar a well as decent service. There is also a small patio area outside that looks promising. Seems like a good place to hang out. The negatives: the food to me was just ok, and not good enough for the price point. I ordered the Wagyu steak and a beer. The presentation was good with the arugula, sauce, and fries, but the steak strips just did not have much flavor-the fries were ok and the lettuce was good. My wife enjoyed her BBQ flatbread pizza. All in all, I will probably come back and give it another chance and try a few more items; I may try to catch that patio when the weather warms up too."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,3,"Ok so let's just start with the vibe of the place, it's pretty cool. We were seated immediately and tended to by our waitress.  She was very helpful in selecting our dinner. She even inquired if we had any allergies which is something most do not. The sauce on the wrapped shrimp was hands down delicious! The tacos were decent; they had double layered shells and I wasn't a fan of those. The meat was tender. I tried my friend's lab burger and it was top notch. I actually would have enjoyed that better. It was served with fries and they were super good! The drink selection was unique and so were the glasses they came in. I like that the restaurant was unique and lab themed. Good location too."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,3,"I had a work meeting that I was interested in doing over lunch. I had heard some things about this place, but didn't really know where it was. So I was surprised to learn that it was in the downtown Hilton. Parking was not the easiest on the street, so I parked in the Hilton deck. I thought I could make it through the hotel, but never figure out how. So I eventually just walked outside and around to the front entrance.There was not another person in there besides the person I was meeting and it stayed like that the entire meal. Our server arrived quickly to take drink orders. But then it took her forever to come back with the drinks. We went ahead and ordered some appetizers when she finally brought the drinks by. Then we didn't see her again for another 15 minutes or so to order our entrees. By that time, the apps had come out. I got the oysters and I didn't think they were anything too special. I know when it comes to raw oysters, the kitchen can't do too much. I usually like them salty and perhaps it was even the cucumber granita that took away some of that saltiness. But again, I can't take anything away from The Lab on something like raw oysters.After sitting with empty glasses for a while, our entrees came out and we were finally given a refill. I got the sirloin. Although the temperature was right on point, the flavor was just not there. The meat had some extremely tough spots and it really wasn't a great steak. The fries were pretty good as was the salad underneath. I will definitely come back and give them another shot since they are fairly new. The ambiance of this place is really cool and looks like a nice patio to come sit when the weather gets warm. Stay tuned for an update. But for now, it was an A-ok experience."
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,4,"After work some friends and I came here  for a nice  Friday GNO - first off, you have to valet park .... it's the most practical thing to do. If not, you'll drive around forever to find parking . valet parking was  $5, whatever... it works in this scenario! I must say that the hotel/valet  staff were extremely nice and helpful . Helped  us get right where we needed to be.  The hotel is beautiful, sign placement was perfect to direct us to the restaurant in the lower level of the hotel . Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the sweetest hostess.... I felt like she could have been my grandma. So warm, friendly and such a gentle spirit ! . She took us to our seats and we had a chance to review the menu before placing our  drink orders. Where our seats were located  , it was cold , so the manager, Danny closed the patio doors and adjusted the air conditioning just to accommodate us as well as other guests. I decided to order just bacon wrapped shrimp and we shared the b- deviled eggs- the b- deviled eggs were so creative looking . They were purple !!! I really enjoyed those!  The bacon wrapped shrimp was drenched in bbq sauce which I did not love!  I ordered this dish based off the previous reviews and pics that  did not include bbq sauce .  I like bbq sauce but this took away from the dish for me.  Disappointment. My friends really enjoyed their food choices and drink choices .  They didn't have a big wine menu but they had some unique cocktail options . The blazer was strong according to my friends - they enjoyed it! A little too much ! The lab kitchen and bar is a great incentive to the Uab area. It's a really good spot to meet up with friends to grab a quick bite to drink .The dessert menu had at least 3-4 options.  I enjoyed the gooey butter cake!! It was YUMMY!"
The Lab Bar and Kitchen,5,"Went on a girls night out to this location and absolutely enjoyed the food! I had the Blazin burger which was big,  juicy and full of flavors! You really get your money's worth for your meal even though it is in a pricier range that's what I'm used to. I tried a cocktail drink called the Blazer which amazed me when the server did a little science experiment in front of us for the drink. I believe it was dried ice and when adding the shot of tequila and then a green juice it would look like is boiling with lots of smoke it was such a cool experience in front of us.Since it was just us girl we lasted for quite a few hours there,which we were never rushed to leave took out time had some dessert and coffee. I really have to brag on one of their desserts which I loved so much but forgot the name.. I do remember it had caramelized bananas, a cookie like crumble drizzle with chocolate and a delicious pastry. This dessert just made my night!!!"
Ash,5,"Ordered takeout this week. Shrimp and grits, as well as the BBQ pork and grits were both awesome!Service was excellent. They said 20 mins to being ready, when I arrived literally 20 mins on the dot, they walked the food right out. Perfect timing, great food.Can't wait to come back! Get out and support local businesses during this COVID disruption"
Ash,5,"We were traveling to Huntsville and looked on Yelp for open food venues during covid and found out this place was open (we gave a call to confirm, too). They have set up for covid very well - sanitizers everywhere, staff wear masks, tables separated far enough. Even menus seemed to be printed newly everyday (bottom of the page had a date). Really impressed. On top of that food and drinks were really good and staff are very nice! I especially loved Carrot Cake Bread Pudding!"
Ash,4,"Came here on a Thursday night and was seated immediately.  The atmosphere is open and rustic with a lot of wood and open space. The Service: We ordered and had our food in front of us within 10-15 minutes so that was great. Our waitress came around a few times to check on us and fill our drinks, but wasn't lingering around us which is always nice. The Food: I ordered the BBQ plate which came with brisket covered in both red & white bbq sauce, baked beans, and homemade coleslaw. To start the brisket was really flavorful and tender, it didn't quite melt in your mouth like some of the best brisket i've ever had but was close enough to it. The homemade coleslaw was a highlight as it was rich and creamy. The baked beans were the first thing I wiped off my plate as I was super hungry, and to be quite honest I don't remember if they were distinct from other baked beans just because they went down so fast. Overall I really enjoyed my experience at Ash as the atmosphere and food are perfect for a great dinner with a small group or a date."
Ash,4,"We saw Ash was a new restaurant in Homewood and, being in that area, took the family.   Ash is in an old storefront across from a beautiful park.  You immediately smell the wood burning grill when you walk into the spartan dining room.  Clean design and a nice bar on the back wall set off the restaurant.  The menu was reasonably priced - especially for the starters - and we tried the Brussel Sprouts cooked in what tasted like a sherry reduction.  Very well cooked with a under flavor of pork fat.  Two in our party had wood fired filets with Gorgonzola mashed potatoes and baby carrots.  Well cooked and a lot of food.  Another had the BBQ plate and the smoked brisket was well cooked and flavorful.  It came with white and red bbq sauce.  I had the winter salad with grilled chicken.  The home made dressing was excellent and the chicken was right off the grill..Simply said, this southern flavored meal was very good with fresh, clean ingredients.   We will be back."
Ash,5,"This is a nice neighborhood place in west homewood.  It's locally owned and has its own local flavor and flare.   They have a nice selection of items for anyone,  from the kids to the parents.   We have gone a few times and had a few different items in the menu,  it's been excellent each time.  Also the wait staff are attentive and helpful!"
Ash,5,"Celebrated my 70th Birthday here . We sat outside at lunch , location , atmosphere and food was amazing with friendly service !"
Ash,5,"Came here for lunch and what a cute place in the Homewood area! I had the smoked salmon benedict because smoked salmon is one of my favorite things and it was delicious! The poached egg was cooked to perfection, neither too runny nor too hard. I also found out that this restaurant is family owned and one time when it snowed, they opened the restaurant and had grilled cheese and chili. That story warmed my heart! If you're ever in the Homewood area, you should definitely check out Ash!"
Ash,4,"This restaurant is fresh and thriving on the Homewood dining scene!  My family and I came to ASH on July 4th (my first ever time here).   When we arrived, there weren't many people inside but apparently , we had just missed the massive crowd! Typically,  my family and I dine out on this holiday specifically because it's way easier to let someone else do the cooking for you!  Ash formulated a  special menu just  for Labor day.  The menu choices included: Ribs, burgers, pork sandwiches or plate  , chicken legs , brisket  and a number of traditional sides. Regrettably when ordering, we were notified that they were out of the pork! This is usually my mom's go to and was what she really wanted.  She ended up with a burger with fries instead.  I went with the Memphis style dry rub ribs with bbq sauce on the side.  The rub on the ribs were a little on the salty side.  The bbq sauce had a really good flavor.  The meat was really tender!!!Other members in my party had burgers and fries/mac and cheese and the brisket sandwich with fries.  The burgers were loaded with fresh ingredients,  cheese and  served on a brioche burger bun.  There was an option to add bacon as well. Bacon makes everything better, right?! The consensus from everyone was that they enjoyed what the ordered.  My nephew was the only one leaving with a to go box! Overall, service for a holiday was good. The staff was quite helpful and very attentive.   I really did like the vibe this place gives.  I love the couch that's in the dining area- makes you feel like you're right at home.  Ash is on my list to try for brunch real soon!   The staff took really good care of our party of 7 - it was a great experience!"
Ash,4,"**** Updated review ****Service much better on my latest visit.I tried the Chicken and Grits this time. Grits nice and creamy. Chicken was flavorful. Stewed tomatoes were very good and seasoned well.Will definitely be back for lunch.At some point I really want to try the bread pudding.*** Previous review ***Trying a new lunch spot.Took longer to be seated than expected due to were not very busy.I had the Double Cheeseburger & Fries from the lunch menu. Despite being cooked to order, it arrived promptly. It was cooked perfectly medium well. Brioche bun was fresh. Seasoned Fries were nice and crisp outside and soft on the inside.Overall was pleased with the lunch experience.I overheard server mentioning that the other waitstaff scheduled had called in, which explained the slight delays.I look forward to returning and trying other items but would not hesitate getting the burger again."
Ash,5,"Wow.... that's really all I can say. Our server Marissa was amazing!!!!!!!! Super on point, helpful with suggestions & a smile on her face the whole time! The music was my favorite kind, 90's, but after the crowd rolled in, we could t hear it anymore. That's ok! I'd rather see this place do well over hearing music. My chicken tenders were huge! Totally home cooked.... nice smokey flavor.... fries were delish & the salad my lunch date had was devine!!!!!! Favorite part? This is gonna sound crazy, but I'm a HUGE fan of the small things.... there are female products AND diapers in the ladies room... I know I know... ew... BUT what an amazing find to see!!!"
Ash,5,"Ash is a place that I have been curious to try for a while. So when I had a lunch meeting that needed a location, I was happy to head over to Homewood and check it out. I am not sure why, but I was initially under the impression that this was a BBQ spot. But it is definitely more of a new American kind of menu.The inside is very clean and bright. The staff we encountered were really friendly and we were promptly brought our drinks. When our waitress delivered them, she asked if we wanted to try the sugar snaps as appetizer and we jumped on board. They were absolutely amazing. The perfect amount of char, the perfect amount of salt, and an amazing texture combination with the tortilla strips. The sauce on them was also an incredible flavor booster.After a lot of back and forth, I decided to do the meat and two. Right now it is their version of fish and chips. I kind of suspected it would not be like traditional fish and chips. So when it wasn't, I wasn't shocked. But what was presented may not have been traditional, but it was incredibly tasty. The fish was perfectly cooked and battered. And again, the sauce boosted the flavors so much further. The potatoes were also really good and the cold coleslaw was a perfect mix with this dish. All in all, a really great trip to Ash and I look forward to going back."
Ash,5,"In the words of Samin Nosrat, this place had it all ""Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat"". This was an amazing eat for such a reasonable price. Their food, particularly their meats are juicy, tender and flavorful. The inside is clean, the service was fast and friendly. It would be the perfect place to come for Sunday brunch!"
Ash,5,"My wife and I love going to Ash for their Sunday brunch. One of the many perks of Ash for brunch is that the menu changes almost weekly. At first, I didn't know if I would like this, since each time I seem to find something I absolutely love and want to get the next time. However, my disappointment at my missing item quickly vanishes when I try one of the new specials. Aside from the exceptional food, the service is second to none, the atmosphere is great, and you can't beat the smell of the wood fire grill. $5 bloody Mary's and mimosas don't hurt either!"
Ash,5,"I love this place! They are always providing fresh dishes. We particularly like the Sunday brunch. Man, I had the Fall Benedict this year...whoo. The chicken tenders fried or grilled are a big hit, and the fries are real good. Burger is great. The seasonal salads are always fresh and very well balanced. Try the restaurant multiple times since the menu changes so much.The staff is super friendly and attentive. Top marks for the whole process here. Plenty of seating options for various dining party numbers."
Ash,4,"I heard good about this restaurant and I thought why not try. I went there for a late lunch. I missed the lunch crowds. The server was very nice and good for casual lunch or dinner. Also, they are right next to magic city sweet ice (if you want cold dessert) and Patriot Park (if you need to walk off if you are too much). I had Blue Plate - Fried Drum Chicken with Grilled Squash with Rice, which was delicious! I would like to try there for dinner next time.Tips: Each day has cocktails deals. Tuesday: $5 Old Fashion Wednesday: Half Off for a Glass WineThursday: $5 Margarita Sunday Brunch: $5 Mimosa and Bloody Mary"
Ash,5,"I am bumping this place to five stars.  Simply put, I crave their burger with portabella mushroom on it and the Drisky Sour is incredible.I just did a to go order and got the salad and three burgers.  The salad with peas, lettuce, beets and squash was fantastic.  The family loved the burgers and fries.They cook everything over an open fire and this place has refined their cooking and delivering great food at a reasonable cost.  A huge fan of Ash!!!!"
Ash,5,"A hidden gem in the Homewood area!!! Happened to come here for a late lunch on a Saturday randomly. Was pleasantly surprised by the tasteful decor. It has a very homey yet elegant feel. They have a big table in middle so this is a good place if you have a big party. Now the FOOD. SO GOOD. You must try the okra as an appetizer!!!! I don't even like okra that much but it was delicious. Came with some type of crunchy stuff on top in a honey balsamic sauce. Grilled chicken sandwich had tons of flavor. Included creamy slaw and nicely toasted bread. Had farro salad which came with roasted,crunchy veggies in it. I'm bringing my family here next time they're in town."
Ash,4,"Directly across from Homewood Park.  Small,One room restaurant with good food.  We both had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, very good.  It looked like everyone there was enjoying their food.  A little loud due to Ash being an open floor plan."
Ash,5,An exceptional restaurant!Food was excellent starting with the brisket nachos and bourbon glazed pork chop for dinner. The sweet potato purée was scrumptious while the chop had a nice  medium color and smokey flavor. Bread pudding dessert was homemade and  very light. Olivia was our server and she was outstanding!Hope this local eatery  is here for many years!
Ash,5,"Ash was a super cool place with great food. We came for a quick breakfast, hoping for their chicken fried steak. Their menu changes daily supposedly, so maybe call ahead if you're hoping for something special. Nonetheless, what we did order off their Sunday breakfast menu was delicious. We started with their beignets with chocolate sauce, which was definitely delicious. I ordered the pork belly grits & my friend ordered the bbq pork benedict. Both were really awesome & we were highly impressed with the flavors. No bland IHOP meals here! If I lived in Birmingham, I'd probably be a regular at this place. Their dinner items look delicious too! I'm sure they get packed at busy times, but it's in a great location across from a park, and there seemed to be lots of parking options as well!"
The Fig Tree,5,"I've been dying to try this place out for quite some time and I finally did!  I'm so glad that I read a couple of reviews about the parking situation ahead of time or else I wouldn't have been able to find it. When you arrive, the front half of the building is a salon and the back half is the restaurant. There's a slim drive way along the left hand side that leads you to the restaurant and additional parking! Now the best part, the food! First and foremost, the crawfish egg rolls are definitely worth the hype. They're cooked so perfectly and crispy and the sauce they use is UNREAL! I ended up ordering the shrimp and grits which might be the best in the state. The consistency of the Grits combined with the flavorful grilled shrimp made this dish unforgettable. Overall, this is a place you MUST TRY. The service is great, the food is great, and the environment is one of a kind. I also suggest making a reservation ahead of time! Makes the seating situation much easier 10/10 would recommend!"
The Fig Tree,1,"This place is ABSOLUTELY horrible....these people must be doing their own reviews.  This place was FILTHY,  water dripping from the ceiling,  trash/food on the floor, flies all over the place.  Got a glance into the kitchen....it was awful.  This place should be shut down....you would seriously do better if you started fasting.Beware possible fake reviews....the owner is HORRIBLE"
The Fig Tree,5,"Every time I try something new here, the first thing out of my mouth is ""Holy Crap, that's delicious!"" (Except that's not honestly the word I choose, because this food is honestly expletive-worthy.)I don't like pork... except from Fig Tree. I don't like rice... except for fig tree. I'm not a burger girl... you see where this is going? The drink menu is also amazing. Elder flower mora? Yes, please. Blood orange mimosa? I need a pitcher. If I had to choose one restaurant to eat at for the rest of my life, this would be the one.  A million stars, highly recommend."
The Fig Tree,5,"Lunch on the patio! What a treat! I love The Fig Tree. We shared Truffle Fries, Fried Green Tomatoes and a vegetable plate with Fried Okra, Squash Casserole and Collards. Everything was delicious. The chef came by to check on us. We love this restaurant. If you have not tried it, you are missing a treat. Five stars!!!"
The Fig Tree,5,"This place is a hidden gem! Found it on yelp and so glad I tried it! It's so quaint and cute. I definitely recommend for brunch. The service was amazing. From sit down to leave, we were only there 45 minutes. I ordered the crab cake situation. A MUST  TRY! The fried green tomatoes made this dish. From looking at other dishes leaving the kitchen, everything looks amazing. Definitely will be back to try the shrimp and grits."
The Fig Tree,4,"Delish! Where to start? Drinks and fried green tomatoes are on point! Our service was 5 star! We had the steak, shrimp and grits, fresh catch, and pasta. I sampled it all and it all was very good. The seasoning in each dish was perfect! You can really taste each ingredient and yet the fresh herbs and spices blended it to perfection! We also tried three small cakes and coffee. They were the best ever! The raspberry and strawberry were my favorites. Fresh and delicious ....... my favorite combo! I can't wait to go back and try the brunch!"
The Fig Tree,5,"My first time coming to The Fig Tree was for brunch on a Sunday . Prior to experiencing this culinary greatness for myself , I heard ALOT of good things! Reallyyy good things! We had a 12 noon reservation and  boy,  am I glad we did because there was a nice crowd already gathered on the patio and in the inside dining area . We were seated on the side nearest to  the bar area, close to a window.  I really appreciated this seat placement; so cozy. The atmosphere was really relaxed. Shortly after being seated, we placed our drink orders . I ordered a mimosa because brunch isn't complete without a mimosa. Right?Our server was very attentive,  gave us time to look over the menu and answer any questions we had. I went with the hot chicken and waffles with a side of hash-browns. The spicy chicken breast was perfectly  seasoned with the right amount of heat!  It  was so moist and crunchy which went exceptionally well with the light and fluffiness of the waffle!    This wonderful dish was topped off with a phenomenal syrup.  I was beyond pleased  - the hash browns were not over cooked so I was able to really taste the potato ; which I loved! Food was some of the best!! I really appreciate their concept of the farm to table perspective.  They really pride themselves on raising their own animals and growing/harvesting their own crops. AMAZING!   Can't wait to try more menu items.  I recommend parking in the back because the upfront parking lot can be difficult to get in and out of."
The Fig Tree,5,One of our favorite Birmingham restaurants. Service is great and food is even better. Whether you're there for brunch or dinner you won't be disappointed. *If they have the ox tail on the menu it's a must try.
The Fig Tree,5,"Had such a cool experience here!My friend and I placed a reservation on a weekday evening which just happened to be the day of the snow ""scare"" a couple weeks ago.  Being the caring employer that he is, chef owner Jon Holland sent all his employees home to keep them safe, so he waited on us himself with help from his daughter.  He gave us a fascinating introduction the concept of the restaurant as well as thoroughly explained the dishes on the menu.  We relied on his expertise for food and drink recommendations.  Plus, he is just a fun dude, so we had a fabulous time!We started off with the crawfish egg rolls, which place an intriguing Southern twist on traditional egg rolls.  They were rich and delicious with layered seasonings.  Next up was the mushroom salad which had a plethora of foraged mushrooms, greens, Stone Hollow goat cheese, and truffle crème.  Probably my favorite dish of the evening!  It was outstanding.  My friend got the shrimp ravioli, which I tasted - it was awesome!  And I got the chop of the day which arrived on a base of delicious creamed corn.  The chop was delightfully smoky and definitely high in fat (which I like), and that creamed corn was addictive!  We finished with apple fry pies and blueberry white chocolate bread pudding.  We were stuffed to the gills and very satisfied.It was exciting to hear the story of how this place has grown, the concepts behind it all, and about some fun, exciting culinary experiments they are planning in upcoming days (which you can read about on Instagram if you are curious)!  Will be back."
The Fig Tree,4,Had a wonderful time here for brunch. We sat outside as it seemed to have more room as the inside looked a bit tight.Our waiter was great. Had a nice personality and told us the history of the place and how they get their food and raise their own animals and feed them grass. He was on top of things and made sure we were comfortable.The food was excellent. I felt like I was at a fine dining 5 star restaurant. Excellent quality and flavor as well as just the right amount of portion sizes. The coffee was brewed perfectly and had a nice strong flavor. We really had a great time and felt like we were out in the country in a relaxing environment. i
The Fig Tree,5,"The food was sensational and the service was just as great! My family of 11 went for brunch and were treated like royalty.  The owner, Jon came out to introduced himself and explain the menu to us. He was very informative and super nice. It was obvious that he loved what he does and takes pride in making people happy with his unique and delicious recipes. The crab cake situation was amazing. I also tried some of the snapper as well as chicken and waffles that my people had, it was just as good. There is something on the menu for everyone. I cannot wait to go back for dinner! I highly recommend Fig Tree Cafe for some local, organic dishes."
The Fig Tree,3,"Ok so this was our first time here and it was Mother's Day brunch.It was a cute little shack but it was pouring rain and they were seating outside on the patio. That was ok because it was covered but a little wet and cool. The people were so very nice. My biggest complaint was for the high price I expected more. Waffles should never be served with the syrup already on them because guess what--- that means soggy waffles. Also, the crispy perfectly cooked chicken was tasteless. We will most likely come back and try dinner and a not so busy day."
The Fig Tree,5,Had the Crab Cake Situation and the Crawfish Rolls and all was amazing !!! Will definitely be back for more
The Fig Tree,4,I had the truffle oil fries and the Red snapper. It was fantastic! This is a small place but big on flavor. It's tucked behind the Summit.
The Fig Tree,5,"Really cute place! Staff was really nice, service was fast and food was amazing. The crab cake situation put me in the best kind of food coma."
The Fig Tree,5,Best burger I have ever had. I love everything they make but the burger is number 1. Everything is delicious and everyone is so friendly. I love this place.
The Fig Tree,5,"Great place for brunch! (I'm sure dinner is fabulous too). Really enjoyed the service, very attentive staff and the food was excellent. Chicken Salad, on the lighter side, was delish and the farm burger out of this wold. Needles to say we will be back."
The Fig Tree,4,"Popped in for brunch yesterday as it was a beautiful day outside. So the wife and I sat on the outside patio. They have a pretty standard brunch menu with most of the traditional options and some unique ones as well. I went with the crab cake situation, which had fried green tomatoes, sunny side up eggs and of course crab cakes topped with chives and hollandaise sauce. It was pretty tasty and filling. My wife went with the hash that they served forgot what was all in it but she seemed to enjoy. Only critique is $9 for a mimosa?!?! Wowzer!! Kind of steep considering the other options for brunch. Some places you can get a pitcher for that price almost. Other than that. Solid brunch experience would come back for dinner."
The Fig Tree,2,"Saturday - 11:15AWe wanted so much to like this ""new to us"" place. We had passed by many times, heard about it through the grapevine and wanted to try for some time. Well, sadly, it was less than stellar. I went for the crab cakes, in particular The Crab Cake Situation, for which they are 'known' and everyone raves about. They were out of crab cakes. Seriously?  I then chose the less than satisfactory 7 Layer Salad Wedge. No wedge but miniature romaine laid on the plate All of 7 peasSprinkle of 1/2 of greater cheese and wedges of tomatoes. See picture attached. I also had the crab claws. Good but not worth the money and was not as filling as the crab cake would have been. My husband bit the Mimi's Truck Stop breakfast. The grits had no salt and were tasteless. Bland. He mentioned he could have gotten a bigger and better testing breakfast for the same money at BBB. I had gone with the intent of finding a new place for my husband and I to enjoy date night and to bring friends if there were space in the nicer indoor room. Oh well!  The search continues."
The Fig Tree,5,"Just trying to find a place to eat this morning, my girlfriend and I came across this place on yelp! Turned out several people who worked there knew Madi from high school so we had a great brunch while they caught up. Great people serving some home run brunch food. Would highly recommend the shrimp and grits or the Nashville hot chicken and waffles!Will be back to check out the dinner menu and their solid beer selection....to be continued..."
The Rougaroux,5,"Rougaroux, Rougaroux, how I forgot how much I love you. And it takes a stay at home order to make me appreciate you even more. Rougaroux is in current first place for my quarantine carry out/delivery competition. Even though we love it, this wouldn't have been a place on our radar during this time... but it is now!My wife saw that they had some leftover beef that they would typically use for their debris and decided to make a burger with gouda and candied jalapenos. Don't expect to go in and get this because it isn't on the regular menu... but I hope it will be! It was absolutely fantastic. We went halfsies on that and their shrimp po-boy. And in most of these deals, I prefer one over the other. But they were so different and so amazingly tasty, that I couldn't pick one. That bread still hits me in my nostalgic heart hole. And the fries were just as good as they would have been in the restaurant (rare in take-out situations). My kids absolutely crushed their shrimp and Zapps that came with it.Not curbside, but they make it very contact free. Friendly, fast and most important... delicious."
The Rougaroux,5,"Great place to eat, delicious po boys. I'm a big fan of the shrimp po boy, but I've tried almost all of them and never had a bad meal here. You get your money's worth, too. Don't worry about leaving still hungry. Staff is always nice, and the atmosphere is relaxed, great for groups if you are willing to sit outside in a covered area or just a couple of people, but if you can't swing that, order takeout. Would highly recommend eating here."
The Rougaroux,4,"Oh my goodness, how have I not tried this place two years ago when I had arrived in Bham. What a gem. Lovely spot with the NOLA vibe and delicious cajun eats! Dog-friendly too! Thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, vibe, and chow. Ordered the gumbo, fried shrimp po'boy and vietnamese cajun noodles. Gumbo = nom nom nom, deliciousFried shrimp po'boy = dank, fat, and crispy fried shrimp on a delicious loaf and bomb sauce. Quite satisfyingViet Cajun noodles = wow, highlight of my night. All that seafood and garlic-flavored. Quite lovely, definitely worth getting again. 4 thumbs up from my gf and I who left quite full and with leftovers. Will be back soon!"
The Rougaroux,4,"Wow what a great find that not too many know about. A friend led me to find this delicious Louisiana/Cajun joint.  The atmosphere is full of ""spooky"" items and Louisiana references which was an awesome touch.The food:I ordered the Surf N Turf Po-boy which is half roast beef debris and half fried shrimp.  This sandwich was big and the taste packed a punch too. The fried shrimp were perfect and even better when dipped in the remoulade.  The roast beef debris was somehow better. Overall the sandwich was everything it should be and was bigger than I expected.The dessert:I was also able to try the bread pudding which was the best bread pudding I've had the pleasure of having. The pecans, caramel/rum sauce, and the pudding melded in a fantastic way. Overall, I was impressed with this small cajun joint, and plan on coming back to grab another po-boy/ bread pudding"
The Rougaroux,5,If you're looking for some good Cajun food this is the place you need to go just beware of the Pirates in the werewolves
The Rougaroux,5,"Reminds me of being home(Mobile) on the bay. They give you large portions of seafood and other cajun food for a really reasonable price. I have fallen in love with everything I've try. My personal favorites are the shrimp poboy and gumbo(shrimp with andouille sausage). If you're ever indecisive and want a tasting of several foods, I'd come on a Saint's game day and enjoy their buffet which is the best in the city imo. It's a great way to catch a game in a homey environment for a great price(about the same as you'd pay for an entree). The space is intimate and gives the vibe of sitting in the living room and watching a game with friends/family...if one of them is a REALLY good cook. There's plenty of abita and local beers to choose from, as well as slushies and standard liquors. Not a bad selection for the Size of the restaurant"
The Rougaroux,2,"The atmosphere of this place is pretty cool. It has that kinda creepy vibe that is both fitting and appropriate for a restaurant that serves the food of an area known for cemeteries, voodoo, funeral parades, etc.The menu is limited with a focus on po' boys, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. I was intrigued by their gumbo, but I opted for their surf and turf po' boy, a po' boy that's half roast beef and half fried shrimp.For twelve dollars I would have expected more in both quality and quantity. The roast beef came with provolone and for a hot sandwich, you would think the provolone would have been  at least partially melted. The roast beef was just not good. I cannot pinpoint a distinct reason for it, it was just not good.The shrimp side of the po' boy was infinitely better, but that was not hard to do. I wouldn't say that it was great, but it was good.The ordering process is that you order at the bar and are given a number. You find a seat and  your food is brought to you.A final comment and perhaps it is just a pet peeve of mine. They upcharge for certain condiments. When I placed my order at the bar, I was asked if I wanted either remoulade or tartar sauce. I asked for the remoulade and discovered when looking at my receipt that they charged fifty cents for the remoulade. I have no problem with paying extra for additional items, but to charge fifty cents for something that literally cost pennies is in my opinion, poor taste.As stated, this place has a great vibe, unfortunately nothing else was worth it."
The Rougaroux,4,"This is a unique little jewel in the forest park neighborhood. Actually , it's quite hidden and can be difficult to find if you blink! I'd gone to The Rougaroux one time prior to my most recent visit and never did a review.  The first time I visited, I had a cup of the seafood gumbo and the roast beef debris poor boy. The second visit , I had a cup of seafood gumbo ,  one pork boudin sausage and some bread pudding.  Seafood Gumbo (Had an odd taste and I didn't care for the oysters. I love oysters so it's hard to explain why I didn't care for them in the gumbo)Roast beef debris po boy (Was tasty and was the perfect size.  The meat was good down and the debris is always my favorite pieces left in the skillet !)Pork Boudin Sausages OMG this sausage was delish and so flavorful- kinda hate that I only ordered one but with the cup of gumbo , one was plenty.  The boudin was served with some spicy mustard on the side , which really complimented the boudin incredibly!! Full of flavor .Bread pudding Had to save the best for last! The bread pudding --- This is coming from someone who normally isn't a bread pudding fan but this bread pudding was phenomenal!! The sauce with pecans on top made all the difference for me / took that bread pudding over the top for me! (Sorry no pic)"
The Rougaroux,4,"This is some of the better Cajun food I've had anywhere. A couple of my coworkers and I decided to try something off the beaten trail, and all of us were excited from the moment we pulled up. Tucked away in an old house that has been transformed into a bayou style hole in the wall, this is no place for decadence. If that's not an issue to you, then you are in for a treat! We all had some combination of the Shrimp Poboy, Seafood Gumbo, and Cajun Fries. All of it was delicious, even better than MANY places I've had in Louisiana. The throw whole oysters in the Seafood Gumbo, and generous chunks of okra. They don't skimp by any means. The full Poboy is more than enough food for one person, I ended up giving half of mine away. They have a bunch of frozen beverages, we tried the purple one (think it had Grapico in it) and the mojito. Both were crisp and refreshing. Only con is I ended up paying 30+ for a Poboy, gumbo, and a drink. A bit more than what i would like to pay for a drink and a meal at a hole in the wall."
The Rougaroux,5,"Love, Love, Love. The Roug is a slice of The Big Easy in the heart of Birmingham. The converted home is an eccentric collection of memorabilia that pays homage to south Louisiana. I felt like I had been teleported to a secret corner of New Orleans. The Rougaroux offers traditional poboys, but what I really appreciate are their specialty combinations. They have created  some bold poboys that they pull off with great confidence. Tonight I had the Rouxbon poboy which is their take on a Reuben sandwich. It was a chalkboard special, and not on the regular menu. The classic ingredients (Corn Beef, Sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and Russian dressing) are constructed on base of Leiidenheimer's French bread. This bread is imported from New Orleans, and it is amazing. The Rouxbon was epic.In New Orleans, enjoying a frozen daiquiri is almost as natural as stopping for a cup of coffee. The Roug offers several options, and I tried the Dark and Stormy. It was good and strong, and having a daiquiri in a styrofoam cup just felt right. One available option is Grapico and Vodka, and  that must be an original. I like Grapico so I'll give it a shot next time."
The Rougaroux,5,"Very ""neighborhood"" feel to this place, which I absolutely love. Great place to watch a football game (especially if you're a Saints fan!) or just grab drinks or food. Crispy crab boiled potatoes are probably one of the unexpectedly tasty things on the menu. They are small potato wedges that are crisped and seasoned with Cajun seasonings. Their muffuletta is also delicious (the bread they use is Gambino's bakery bread from Metairie). The frozen Apple Cider was super delicious. I hope they come out with a hot version (kind of like a hot toddy), especially with the colder weather."
The Rougaroux,5,"This place has really grown on me.  The first time we came a few months ago I didn't love it, but I didn't write a review because I knew it was probably more because we weren't familiar with the food than the food actually not being good.  We went back a couple of weeks and tried some of the dishes that we are more familiar with...and they were awesome!  Been back twice since then and will go back again.  Staff are all very nice.  They do a good job with to go orders too, taste just as good at home!"
The Rougaroux,4,My husband and I gave the rougaroux another try. This time drinks only. We love the frozen drinks. All flavors we have tried have been delicious and stiff. We had 2 rounds on the balcony. We'll be back for the drinks and unique decor. I'll probably try some food again in the future.
The Rougaroux,4,"I must be getting a little spacey these days, I thought I did a Yelp a review for this wonderful place. So today we took 3 of our oldest grandchildren so they could experience New Orleans style Cajun.Don't know about the evening hours but lunch & afternoon it's order at the counter. House made Boudin Links, todays were smoked pork with a spicy brown mustard, the kids tried some but didn't come back for more (I think it was the name) that was ok with me and the wife, we devoured one and got one to go.Crawfish Zombie Bread was nice n cheesy, good spice but short on mud bugs. Wife's fried oyster Po'Boy was spot on good. (She wouldn't let me try & that's a first) Two Fried Chicken Po'Boys disappeared along with the creole garlic fries. I did sneak some fries, spice was good as was the garlic, they use a mild garlic that works in harmony with the fries. One Fried Catfish Po'Boy made a short visit and was gone. The Grandkids say they might like to visit The Big Easy one day. Service Good..."
The Rougaroux,1,"I was so excited to try this place, but instead had the worst sandwich of my life. I got the eggplant poboy and asked for it to be made vegan, since previous reviews showed it was possible. I expected a sandwich with eggplant and maybe other veggies (lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.) nothing crazy. Instead I got a beige disaster of just soggy eggplant and bread. The eggplant had absorbed all the oil and tasted like licking a deep fryer. That paired with the fact it had no toppings for some reason (unlike the rest of my companion's sandwiches, which were loaded with veggies) made it terrible. I don't expect every restaurant to have plant-based options, but when they do I'd like for them to at least be edible. I ended up eating chips for lunch and making do with that."
The Rougaroux,4,Enjoyed the smoked duck gumbo more the boudin as I make mine crispy lately on the grill. Fun atmosphere with the where wolves or creatures decorated outside. Was totally bummed out that the turtle and veal meatball po boy was not available now or maybe ever. Really was the only reason I was headed here but had a good time nonetheless.
The Rougaroux,5,Incredible Po Boys in a old country house setting. Red Beans and Rice is on point too.Update 6/6/19 had the special. Which was swordfish. And it was the best piece of fish I've had while not looking at the ocean. The chicken andouille gumbo was also supreme
The Rougaroux,3,"It's okay. I wavered between two and three stars. I finally decided to give three stars because, hey, anybody can have a bad night. Let me put it this way. When a restaurant is investing way more energy and attention to setting a mood than the food it puts on a plate, it's got its priorities backwards. Personally, I think the people squealing like teenaged girls over this place are gulled by its ambience, not the food. I mean it certainly tries to pour on the charm with all the expected New Orleans kitsch, but c'mon. First, they were critically short-staffed. People were literally standing around waiting for tables to be cleared in a cramped dining room with scanty air conditioning. I think that's taking the bayou experience a bit too far. Second, the food was just meh. And I say that as someone who loves gumbo and a good po' boy. We ate and strolled down to Little Savannah for dessert. Now, those guys know how to run a restaurant."
The Rougaroux,5,I am visiting family for the holidays and they took me here last night...OMGOODNESS!! Best gumbo EVER! The blackened shrimp and brussel sprouts were awesome! Also the sangria slushy was excellent! Plus a cool intimate atmosphere!
The Rougaroux,5,Wow..... delicious!  Everything was excellent except the brussel sprouts which were burnt.  Exchanged for the red beans and rice which was soooooo good!  Try this place!!  Yummy!
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"I'm writing about this establishment based upon its phenomenal covid-19 response. It is by far one of the cleanest and responsible establishments I have been to since quarantine. There are several stations and everything is lined up outside. The tables are so far spaced out that you don't have to worry about someone being in your space. After each party leaves, a worker quickly comes over to sanitize the table. Even more impressive is the way they do the food. You order, and then they place your food in an area that is labeled A-F (I think) and then they call your name over the intercom and you pick up your food from that specific area--contactless. Plus the beers are great. If you do get a 22oz, be aware that they are high gravity, so drink responsibly. I tried the sour, which was so refreshing, and one of the high gravity beers which I shared. Both were yummy and not too filling."
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"This brewery is one of the best in Birmingham. It has a great outside seating area and a very large inside eating area as well for those days it's just a little too hot or rainy. Their food is top notch, I love their burger! They have great pizza too. Back Forty has a great selection of beer, but my favorite is the Bamamosa, it's like a beer mimosa which sounds strange but is really great. In the summer this is our number one hangout because of outdoor games and patio. During COVID, back forty is offering curbside pickup for food and beer and will even fill growlers for you!"
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"I have really wanted to come to Back Forty since they opened who knows how long ago. Since having twins, brewery visits are one of those things that have dwindled over the years. And with the recent surge of restaurants in Birmingham, it has been hard to make it a priority. But leave it to a global pandemic for us to finally come here after seeing them advertise their curbside ""hoppy meal"" that comes with a burger, fries and a bomber of beer.Seeing that they do have a kids menu makes me feel a little guilty about not bringing the kids earlier. But I am glad that we were able to finally support them. The process was extremely easy. We ordered online and were sent a text of what parking spot to pull in. Our person avoided as much contact as possible, was extremely friendly and we were in and out in a matter of minutes.It is really hard to judge food for the first time as take out. So we went into it with an open mind that the food had to be in a to-go box for an extended amount of time... and it was still really good! You could definitely tell it would have been better there. But a really tasty meal all around."
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"Of course the beer is delicious, but it is rare that I crave food from a beer company. My favorite burger in Birmingham remains at this place! I consistently check the website to look at the new additions they make to their food menu. All of their sandwiches are delicious as well as the pizza options. Recently, I ate the Korean sandwich and was delighted with the choice. Back Forty has won the Birmingham race for best food at a brewery, if not some of best food in Birmingham!"
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,4,"A good friend of ours said on Facebook that he was headed here on yesterday so my husband and I decided to go there too. We had never been, but we have heard so many good things about the food. When we went in, we decided to sit at the bar. An employee at the bar, a tall gentleman, walked by us multiple times and did not ask if we need assistance or if we were ready to order. We had been sitting there for about 6-7 minutes as the employee was either oblivious to us or intentionally ignored us. Fortunately, another employee, a younger woman, stopped and asked us if we had been helped. I told her we hadn't and she jumped right in to assist us. She gave us recommendations about things on the menu and was genuinely helpful. We actually had a good conversation about tattoos. She is the reason my first impression of this place wasn't completely ruined. Now, the food was awesome! I got the Confit Chicken Wings. Those are some of the best wings I've ever had. How they pulled off crispy and moist wings...I'm not sure, but they were so good! My husband ordered the Korean BBQ Beef Bowl and I had a bite of it. His food was delicious as well. I had an order of their fries as well and they were great too. Their food lives up to the hype. Hopefully, the next time we are here, we will experience good service from beginning to end."
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"I really love Back Forty! It's got a huge space both indoor and outdoor. Even when it's crazy busy there's plenty of room for everyone. I also absolutely love a brewery in Birmingham that has food! I've been here many times and have tried different things on the menu. Everything I've tried has been amazing. They have a great regular menu that changes seasonally. They also have incredible specials. One time a ramen was on the special and I was pretty skeptical but they staff recommended it. Oh my goodness. So good! Their burgers are always great as are pizzas. But their fries are probably my favorite with the garlic aioli. When it's seasonally available on the menu, their poutine is absolutely the best!"
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"Birmingham you've surprised me with your oh so chilled out beer scene and Back Forty was the first stop I made on my beer tour of the area. Arriving for business, I decided to take some time out and do some exploring. What better way to see the urban revitalization and the overall people scene than hit up a few local breweries. I came in to Back Forty through the back so I didn't get the full effect of the joint until I came around to what I will deem the front.  Spacious and lots to look at and do. Forty has bags, ping-pong and a whole lot of space to just hang out. It was a nice day out so there were groups of people enjoying it all. I was impressed right there alone. Any place that stocks up on the games is a solid in my book. On to the goods though. I drank three different beers from a hoppy IPA to a nice Imperial Stout. The brew was great and stood on its own that these guys know how to brew. I was very pleased at this point. A diverse staff and lively space just made for a pleasing visit. I also ordered food and the food is partially the main reason I made this the first stop. Before packing down some brews, I knew I'd need a good meal. Forty didn't disappoint in the least. I had a nice grilled fillet of catfish on a soft and buttery bun with a dose of slaw and some type of sauce that was just oh so good. They served that up on a metal tray loaded with a gang of shoestring potatoes. Back Forty I'm not sure when I'll ever get back down to Birmingham but if ever I do again I will be back! You guys are on point!"
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"If you're looking for a place to hang out with some friends for some casual beers and food, then this is your place! Honestly, the 5 stars is for the overall atmosphere of the place. Think of a summer afternoon chilling outside in the backyard drinking some beers and eating some burgers as the sun sets, and you basically captured the essence of Back Forty. Just like those summer nights, your dogs are allowed to hang outside with you as well! They have ample room for you and your group to sit inside or outside. They also had some corn hole and a ping pong table outside for people to play. In addition to a bunch of dogs, you'll also see a bunch of kids as this is a family-friendly place. I came here with a group of friends on a Friday evening, and we were able to nab an area outside to eat and drink. I ended up ordering the Back 40 cheeseburger, which came with fries. The burger was good, but I would say the star of the show was the fries. They were so crispy and thin. I loved them! They were a tad salty, but dipping them into ketchup fixed that. I would say the food would be 4 stars. I'm not much of a beer person, so I didn't get a drink, but my friends who did seemed to enjoy theirs. My friends and I ended up staying out there for about 3 hours, and the crowd never died down. I think this is just a testament of how popular this place is and how it warrants at least one visit!"
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"Bang for your buck: 9/10Quality: 9/10Service: 10/10Ambiance/Location: 10/10Overall: 9.5/10It's not every day we go to a brewery and enjoy the food more than the beer. The food at Back Forty is surprisingly good. It moves beyond typical bar food without pretension. We enjoyed the cheeseburger and fries and the pimento cheese dip. Both were other worldly. We also tried several of the beers on tap while rocking in comfy rocking chairs on the outside porch area, which overlooks the Sloss Furnaces Park. Perfect quiet Sunday afternoon vibes for a beer and a burger! We learned that the tap list gets updated often, so even if you've been before, it's a great time to head back as you'll likely discover a new brew ya love!"
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,4,"Our Uber driver suggested we check out Back Forty and I'm glad he did.  What a great space--it's a little tricky to find but isn't that part of the fun?  The venue is really large with outdoor seating and indoors.  It's very family friendly--there were kids all over the place.  They have a huge, long bar and also a lot of tables for families and large parties.Tyler was our bartender and he was great.  He was quick to come by, get our drink orders and check back with us.  He was really busy with all of the people but we never felt rushed--even when we ordered flights of beer.  I know that flights are a pain for bartenders, so I always appreciate a bartender with a good attitude.We wanted a snack and ordered the Charcuterie.  There were three different types of meat and all were good.  I really liked the house-made pickles and pickled onions on the side.  So good.Give Back Forty a try--it was one of our favorite stops on our brewery tour!"
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,3,"Modern, industrial venue. Large open space, very nice. Lots of inside and outside dining. If you choose outside dining/drinking make sure you dine on the backside of the restaurant, not facing the overpass, which can be very noisy.I had the grilled chicken sandwich, although good, was definitely over seasoned. I chose to forgo the hot sauce - mistake! That would've made the sandwich complete and was an error on my part. Their fries are thin and crispy yet still pretty tasty.Of course, I also had a flight of beers. The Wee Heavy was excellent; Cart Barn a bit too light for my preference; the Crow Point I could not even finish. It had a seriously heavy vanilla caramel flavor; the High Hazard was over the top as expected. Not especially flavorful, but their aim is for high alcohol content and IBU's in this DIPA."
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"This has to be my favorite place to get wings! All of my stars go to the wings.....I mean, they are ABSOLUTELY  delicious!  ( see my tip page on how to order them) I've had them  at least three times and I'm pretty content with ordering them every single time! Ordering was pretty easy and fast at the counter. Their menu is packed with options from salads, chicken sandwiches, pizzas and burgers. Oh , and they have excellent fries as well! On my last visit  here ,  the restaurant leader/executive chief engaged us and he was so nice to answer questions about our meals. I was left with the impression that he cared about each dish and took pride in making sure the best was being served to me as well as other patrons of Back Forty! Great feeling!I really need to try more from the menu but the wings have a strong hold on me! Once I try some  other menu items , I'll update my review. Stay tuned...In addition to their impressive in variety food menu - Back forty offers an array  of beers, obviously.The  few I've had were well crafted.  I'm not a huge fan of the rocks in the larger parking lot but this doesn't take away from the great experiences I've had here."
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,Love this place. The food and service is amazing. It's a wonderful environment and casual but upscale food.
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"So let me say first and foremost, I love their outdoor patio area. It is by far one of my top faves in Bham to meet up with friends and hang out. AND they have rocking chairs! (Okay so I love rocking chairs lol) They've also got different games like cornhole etc. I really love the fact that they serve their own food. And they have something different daily/weekly so you're able to try new stuff. I got the bi bim bop last time I was there and it was very good! Pricey but good!"
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,4,If stopping by The Sloss Furnaces drive 2 minutes across the street with free parking and grab yourself some fries and a flight of beer. Gaze upon the Wolf Wall to see the many dog pictures. Menu looked unique I enjoyed the fries with ketchup and aoili sauce more than my beers. But the hazy New England style ipa had to be the best one that afternoon. Nice friendly people not afraid to engage out of towners in a conversation.
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"Overall, this place is great! We brought a 100 person event here and they handled us very well. The outside has so many areas to chill or play games everyone in our party including me really enjoyed it. Things to note: most breweries allow dogs but since this brewery is pet restaurant, dogs are not allowed inside for sanitary reasons. We still brought ours outside though! Second, when speaking about hosting the event, there was a bit of confusion between me and a manager but it was soon settled when the head chef came out and greeted me. Chef Bodner was very friendly and I decided to have a burger when the party and I swung by. The burger and fries were great!!! I'm definitely going to try some of their other foods when I'm back next time! See you soon back 40."
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,3,"I went to this location with some coworkers after the lunch hour rush about 2 pm expecting to eat from their regular menu. As it turns out they were trying something different that week between 2-4 which I could only choose from the pizza menu or any other cold meal such as salads, which was not what I expected to try for my first time there. I went ahead and tried their pizza,  the Housemade Lamb bacon. So, overall the flavors were good but there were two things that over power the pizza. First of all the bottom of the pizza was burnt and just made the pizza have an off taste. Secondly their was a bitter powder on the pizza, which I believe is the flour used when extending the dough, this made it hard to really appreciate the other ingredients on the pizza. I really liked eating part of the pizza that did not have a burnt spot or the accumulated powder if it wasn't for that then o would definitely rate this a 5 star meal.I however will try and come back for their wings that some coworkers been raving about but at a different time."
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,2,"To no one surprise, I'm not a beer drinker at all! -_-    Now lately, I've dabble into a few breweries across here in Birmingham and this place came recommended from a friend of a friend, but for the food and atmosphere. I was very hesitant in writing this review because the stars are coming from the fact the waitress didn't inform me about sampling a beer or two before purchasing a flight for $10. I was so pissed because the beer wasted and I couldn't enjoy it! Secondly, the waitress also failed to inform me of the happy hour specials. How does one work in an establishment and not try to make a customer first time a bit easy? Will I revisit? Yes, because the ambiance is nice and they have the space to cater a large crowd, and most of my crowd are beer drinkers. I was particularly fond of ANY beer but hey, I'm not a beer drinker!"
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,5,"FIVE stars means I must return.  This is the only brewery/restaurant of this kind in Bham.  Great food and beer that is brewed on site, great service, plenty of tv's for sports events, and such a cool mix of indoor and outdoor seating/tables.  My wife and I went here for the SEC championship game just a few days ago and had a great time.  The place was packed, all of the televisions were on, and the volume of the game was just loud enough to hear without being overly loud.  We sat at the bar, had two dishes from the special game day menu, and had a few beers.  I will definitely be here again when Im looking for that brewpub experience but I could also see myself going here just for beer or taking someone who doesnt drink because of the cool atmosphere and good food.  FOOD - we loved both of the food items we got (conecuh dog and fried lasagna) and I saw lots of other things on the menu that I wanted.Drink - I had several of the beers and liked them all.  I really liked the Jalapango DIPA which has such a great blend of jalapeno, mango, and hoppy bitterness.  I have had it in cans too!  Just as yummy.  I had some of the other special beers like the NEIPA and a tropical IPA.  I think on a future visit I will try some of the darker beers like the peanut butter porter or the coffee stout.  I really want to mix those two!  My wife had some of the tamer beers like the wheat and the hefeweizen and she liked both of those.  So for the adventurous beer drinker of someone who wants to stay with the more basic styles, this is the place. Service - our server at the bar was great.  She was friendly, knew the menu (beer and food), and had plenty of recommendations.  Im looking forward to returning!"
Back Forty Beer Company Birmingham,4,"Definitely my new favorite brewery with good beer AND food. Ample seating indoors with TVs and foosball table. Outdoor seating with cornhole and more. Food menu changes often so you can always come back to try more great eats from snacks to small plates to large one. Winter is the perfect time to come. I'm a dark beer kinda guy and now they have the peanut butter porter. Absolutely delicious. Bold, heavy bodied, nutty and smooth. Loved it. Will be back again many times to continue enjoying the beers and food along with good company. Overall good beers, food, nice location and friendly staff. All for a fair price. A great new spot in Bham for sure."
The Anvil Pub & Grill,5,Y'all.... I've been eyeing the menu since they starting publishing it which was unfortunately right before the CoVID shutdown . I was so excited to see they had weathered the storm and been able to open for dine in .They did not disappoint . Staff was fantastic. Menu was diverse and everything we got was absolutely fantastic. We chose patio seating and felt incredibly safe with social distancing and the staff taking great precaution . It was amazing to have a great date night and even better to have fantastic good and drinks . I had the pork loin and my husband had the fish and chips . We are both looking forward to the next trip and next choices
The Anvil Pub & Grill,5,"FIRST NIGHT OUT IN 9 WEEKS!!!  I need to put this in caps to emphasize just how long it's been since I sat at a table in a restaurant and enjoyed a glass of wine and a nice dinner.  So, so happy I chose Anvil Pub & Grill.  Clearly management has taken every precaution and regulation to task.  The outdoor space is delightful and they are seating inside as well, even at the bar with bar seats grouped in two's and more than 6 feet apart.  Wait staff was friendly and attentive.  Timing was perfect from getting drinks, appetizer and main course.  My french rose was delicious, wings were superb and my fish and chips crazy good.  I mean just perfect.  My Mom had the Steak Pie and she literally ate it all!  My Mom is 88 years old and we have always enjoyed going out to dinner.  I have been ultra cautious with her and tonight was such a breath of fresh air.  She felt safe as did I.  Please, please patronize this restaurant.  They truly care and love what they do and it shows.  Food is amazing!  Service is great!  Ambience to the max!Thank you for allowing my Mom and I to feel normal again!!  We will be back!!"
The Anvil Pub & Grill,5,"Great food, service and atmosphere. The Shepherd Pie was spot on to quote a famous British chef and the rest of the menu looks fantastic! Nice selection of British and local Birmingham beers on tap... I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"
The Anvil Pub & Grill,5,"Beautiful restaurant, fantastic food, and top notch service.  Definitely will be be heading back again soon so I can try everything else on the menu."
The Anvil Pub & Grill,4,"My family visited The Anvil Pub & Grill for the first time on 3/15. I noticed when we walked in that the floor felt slippery and greasy when we walked on it. We were there on a Sunday for their Sunday brunch menu. Our server was rather loud and inattentive. While we were waiting to order he was just standing in kitchen talking to other members of the staff. There were a couple of times that my glass was empty when he was just standing around. Our food was really good! I ordered the shrimp and grits which was very tasty but but not worth $24, maybe $18. My nephew got some delicious looking French toast. My sister-in-law got a breakfast sandwich which also looked great. Her husband got the Anvil burger which he liked. I tried one of his fries which were great. My husband just got bacon and eggs which he said were good. We all loved the food, but we're not impressed with our server. We will definitely go back because we saw several other things we would like to try."
The Anvil Pub & Grill,5,"What a wonderful dining experience. From the smile with which the hostess greeted me to the delicious sausage rolls and the strawberry tart, it was delicious! The burger was served on a house made brioche bun and my favorite Burger I have had in town yet! I felt fancy and comfortable at the same time!"
The Anvil Pub & Grill,5,Great meal. Great atmosphere. Can't wait to go back.The Sunday Supper lamb was amazing. Scottish eggs incredible. My wife had the burger and loved it. Finished up with bread pudding that was heavenly.
The Anvil Pub & Grill,5,"Great atmosphere and ambiance. Everything that we ordered was exceptional (bangers& mash, steak and Guinness pie, fish and chips and sticky toffee pudding for dessert) especially the bangers and mash. Highly recommend giving this place a try."
The Anvil Pub & Grill,3,"Meh. It's new, the interior is pretty, the food looks good. The wedge salad was good, the chicken sandwich was dry, the fries were decent. I won't run back, but I would give it a second chance."
The Anvil Pub & Grill,5,"Amazing food, wonderful service, and involved owners. They also have one of the best bar environments in Birmingham. Check this place out."
Yummefy,5,"On this Thank You Thursday, I want to thank Yummefy for being a place that I wanted to try. For being a place that was there for us when we really needed something safe, tasty and convenient. And for being an all around great experience for us.Through the quarantine, we have really wanted to branch out and try places we hadn't before. This is a place that I regret saying, it took all of this to get us to try Yummefy... but I am glad that it happened!Spring rolls were the perfect amount of crispy to filling ratio. Pad Thai was different with the flat noodles. But was absolutely amazing. The shrimp fried rice blew our socks off. And stayed that way for leftovers the next day. Really tough for a rice dish to do!!The ordering was easy. The delivery was great. The meal was perfect. And all I can do is say thank you with a 5 star review."
Yummefy,5,"The food and service is wonderful! Fresh, delicious food and friendly staff! A great choice!We ordered pad Thai, chicken low mein, chickpea salad, and chicken curry. Everything was delicious, the salad was so refreshing and the curry was really flavorful. My mom doesn't eat meat, and this place had some great options for her. I'd highly recommend eating here or ordering takeout!"
Yummefy,5,"Yummmmmm!!!! We had the Spicy Himalayan chicken and Gorkhali chicken. BOTH were excellent!! Personal opinion I could take the edamame a little more chilly-garlic but I get having to please the masses. They were didn't have unsweet tea (times of COVID and all) so they called and offered to replace it with something else. They were very courteous and cheery, which we all need right now."
Yummefy,4,"This is a review for their delivery. Their drunken noodles and chicken momo (Nepalese dumpling) were very tasty. Portions were decent, too. I loved the lemongrass chicken in the momo. They also give you 10 decently sized pieces, which is generous compared to what other restaurants offer. If you're looking for a light lunch, an order of momo is a great option!The Tofu Pad Thai was just alright. Very salty, though - probably won't try again.I look forward to trying their curries next!"
Yummefy,5,My grandchild felt like famous people when we left because of the special treat we received and the great dishes we enjoyed on our visits.   The owners recognize us when we entered and suggested new dishes based on our last visits.  Just little small extra attention that made us feel like they appreciate our business.   The grandchildren love the food and look forward to our next visits.  Kudus and know we will be back soon.
Yummefy,3,"This is a review that will probably have to be modified upon more visits. I came when they first opened, excited for a new place to get pad Thai. Just like most places around Birmingham, it was not very good. Didn't have much flavor at all, much too sweet. Not a good dish overall.I avoided coming back for a while but finally ended up trying the coconut curry, and to my surprise it was really delicious! Extremely rich, large portion, very fresh and had big juicy chunks of chicken. Unsure if they changed things up or you just need to know what to order! But looking forward to trying the rest of the menu and finding out! Plus, the owners are extremely nice and personable when you come in. That goes a long way! Fingers crossed they last and continue to improve in this high turnover location."
Yummefy,3,"I think this place potentially has better dishes than the one I ordered and for that reason, I'm not giving it the two stars that I think the dish kinda deserves.Ordered the drunken noodle and I think it lacked a depth of flavor. It felt completely submerged in sodium and it wasn't pleasant. The veggies that were sporadic throughout the dish felt like a reprieve from the noodles that were quite literally drunk off whatever extremely salty sauce combination it was given. Not sure if it was the day that I went in that it happened to be like that or if it is consistently that salty. Ate all the veggies and about half of the noods and had to call it quits. Would be willing to give it another try if the dish were executed differently. The location of the place is extremely convenient for a lunch break if you're at UAB without a car (which would probably be best case scenario bc the parking is just street parking). I remember the service was friendly, space was clean, and the environment gives a step above fast casual bc of the rolled silverware which was a nice change of pace from the places next to it. Might give this place another go at some point because there are some decent reviews about other dishes, the prices are reasonable ish (and there's a 10% if you check in on yelp!), and it's walking distance from class!"
Yummefy,5,Wow these drunken noodles set it off the other night! Came by for a quick dinner and was not disappointed. The noodles were tender and fully coated with a sweet and savory sauce that kept you licking your lips! The dish came with broccoli which was also perfectly cooked. I asked for mediumheat and it was definitely more on the safe/mild side which was fine for me so if you like spicy you can definitely request it and they will kick it up some not he's! My SIL asked for Indian spicy and it was a nice heat level! Would dine in here or take out. Planning to try more menu items as well.
Yummefy,4,"Wow, this Asian fusion restaurant sure has extraordinary food!! Everything looks appetizing. All my  friends really enjoyed their dishes which we all tasted each others and just couldn't get enough of it. My first time at the restaurant I had the Spicy drunken noodle. At first I was surprise of how the noodles looked but once I took a bite, I was hooked.  Beware of choosing spicy, only if you love the heat then I would definitely recommend it. There were so many wonderful flavors that filled my noodle plate, and my chicken was so juicy and infused with all the seasonings. My second time I had the Spicy Gorkhali chicken with white basmati rice, kimchi and yum yum sauce. Like all their dishes, this dish is also full of flavors. Beware that there is an ingredient on the dish that felt like I was eating popcorn husk, but still ate it anyway, didn't mind it.  I love the fact that every dish is full of flavors but each has its own distinctinction from the others.Definitely a place I will keep coming back to."
Yummefy,5,"I'm so happy that this place exists. I've tried drunken noodles, fried rice, and coconut curry so far. Coconut curry is my favorite. I asked for medium spicy and it was perfect heat. Enough for two small dinners.  so happy for this addition."
Yummefy,4,"We've passed by here several times going to other restaurants but decided to try it out today. We went around lunch but it was not busy. I really didn't know what to order so I ordered the Pad Thai, the same as two others in our group. We ordered back to back. However when the food started arriving to the table I was the last one and it took mine longer to arrive. Not sure the hold up but my frustration lessened as I began to finally eat because the meal was good!!! I loved the rice noodles, seasoned chicken and shrimp with the nuts that added a nice texture and the kick of green onions. The quality and quantity was on point. I only ate half because I had a filling breakfast. Even without a heavy breakfast I still think I would have leftovers. So the price was good for the amount of food. I will definitely return to try other menu options."
Yummefy,5,"Fantastic asian fusion restaurant, with excellent service! Would definitely recommend the tikka masala."
Yummefy,4,"I've passed by Yummefy a handful of times on my way to grab food from some of the surrounding restaurants, but I decided to stop by and check it out recently. I was craving pad thai and my usual restaurant is closed on Mondays so I figured I might as well try out a new place that's conveniently located downtown. The restaurant wasn't super crowded when I was there and the food came out pretty quickly! The pad thai was freshly cooked, bursting with flavor, and had plenty of shrimp and chicken in it. While I'm still partial to the restaurant that I normally go to, this was definitely a nice surprise, and much more of a convenient location for me to visit as it's located downtown. That being said, their menu contains a wide variety of dishes, and I'm excited to try their drunken noodles or some of their curries next time I stop by. They also currently have a deal going on through Yelp where you can get 10% off of your order if you check in, so definitely check it out!"
Yummefy,4,"Disclaimer: It is an affront to my moral standards to eat at establishments that serve (unrelated) pan-Asian cuisine (that is not intentionally ""fusion""), but in the case of Yummefy, I will make an exception, due to the frequency at which I eat here and consistent quality of the food. From my understanding/first time eating here, Yummefy served a combination of Nepalese/Indian cuisine (not that I'm an expert on either), but as the months have gone by they've branched into Thai/Chinese take-out as well. Much to my surprise, I've enjoyed everything I've ordered here. I enjoyed the Gorkhali and Spicy Himalayan Chicken off the Nepalese menu (but why is it served with kimchi?)I have also enjoyed their Thai iterations of Spicy Basil Chicken and Spicy Drunken Noodles. I am glad they respect/understand that when I want something to be *SPICY* I want it to be actually so, and the last time I had the Spicy Drunken Noodles, it was very hot/delicious. The owner of this establishment is very cute/friendly/nice, and he always greets customers warmly & with enthusiasm. Would recommend coming here to eat (turn-around during lunch time is pretty fast so you can call ahead or just order there and you won't have to wait long at all)."
Yummefy,4,"Very interesting Asian restaurant in the UAB area.I would not call it Indian, neither​ Chines​e,​ or ""fusion"". I think they are their own thing!Very tasty after all, but that's in part thanks to a large use of salty dressing. A bit too salty for my taste. Indeed, enough too salty to make me limit eating there just once in a while instead of often.The place otherwise looks very nice, welcoming, and clean. Possibly the most clean looking in the area.The staff is super nice, which is a big pro.They aslo have a small seating area outside which is great of you have a dog with you!Overall a great place."
Yummefy,3,"My disclaimer is I'm from LA, and we've got a pretty large ""Thai Town"" (it's hella big actually).  I came out looking for Thai food, came up in Yelp, and I found Yummefy.  I say all this cuz Yummefy was a mix of different Asian cultures, mostly Indian sub continent it seemed, man at counter told us he was Nepalese.  He said it was a fusion of Asian flavors. Thai wasn't the vibe I got...or the taste. We got the coconut soup and Yummefy soup bowl, with chicken. Got the spicy Himalayan chicken too.  My coconut soup was watery, and maybe that's how it's made here, but not what I'm used too (it was ok tho). My partner said his soup was bland, and ramen tasted out of the package.The Himalayan chicken was peppery and spicy (and I like spicy), and they have us what seemed like homemade(?) kimchi. I gave this place three stars cuz the owner seemed sincere, bland soup and good chicken. Another plus was Asians were cooking the food (not used to that at home).  I'd come back..."
Yummefy,5,"During a road trip on thanksgiving day we were looking for a place to eat in Birmingham AL. We were looking for soul food but just about every place we tried was closed. Found Yummefy on yelp. Did not have a lot of expectations walking in to restaurant but was I wrong. Food is simply amazing, they make it to your spicy level. Highly recommend spicy basil fried rice, spicy basil chicken. I also recommend the spicy chicken skewers. Very clean inside and nicely decorated. Very clean bathrooms. Outstanding customer service with super friendly staff."
Yummefy,5,Absolutely delicious! Best customer service and wonderful atmosphere. We ordered Chicken tikki masala and Himalayan Chicken and owner threw in complementary spring rolls at the counter (where you place your order). We definitely be back!
Yummefy,4,"Came here for lunch on a weekday. They were pretty busy, but everything moved quickly. They operate in a fast casual system. The service was great and the owner was super helpful and nice. I decided on the Gorkhali Chicken. The chicken was seasoned well and I enjoyed all the seasoning. I added some extra sauce to kick the heat up even more. The rice was standard and I enjoyed mixing it with my chicken. Next time I'm going to ask to get my order extra spicy. Overall a tasty place to get some quick food or order takeout."
Yummefy,4,I was glad to see that this restaurant was close to the hotel I was staying at--within walking distance. I went there for dinner.It is a very nice restaurant where you order at the counter and they bring it to you. The staff were extremely friendly and the food excellent. The portions were rather large so I got a to go box for the next evening. Definitely going back here on my next trip to Birmingham.
OvenBird,5,Delicious! Unique menu that's great for a large group! The beef fat candle was memorable and they branded our dessert at the table! Definitely a place worth a visit if you're in The Ham.
OvenBird,1,"Arrived there from out of town 18 minutes late for reservation, they REFUSED to seat us, said their late policy is 15 minutes.Really?That was the most disgraceful treatment by any restaurant I have ever experienced in my life. The arrogance and disrespect is off the chart.If there was a ZERO, I'd give it."
OvenBird,4,"My in-laws were raving about this place so I had to frequent this establishment as soon as I came to town. Upon arriving, I was delighted to find that they have a decent size parking lot! I parked quickly and walked right in. I didn't have a reservation but I showed up around 6/6:30, so I was seated immediately. Soon after I was seated I noticed the restaurant started filling up fast, so I got there just in time. Their outdoor patio area was closed because it had been raining and the indoor seating was limited. This is a tapas style restaurant so the idea is to order several dishes. We ordered the ceviche, the shishito peppers and the Peruvian chicken. All the items were delicious! Our waiter had suggested the Peruvian chicken and told us that it was a huge portion! I'm glad he did because that filled us right up! It was a big portion of chicken, rice and beans! I even had food left over! I don't usually have dessert but we were celebrating our ten year anniversary so we thought why not! At the end I decided to try the chocolate cake and it was so dry and just not good! I was deeply disappointed and told the waiter and he told me their pastry chef had quit. I would avoid ordering dessert then!If you go hungry just remember each plate starts at about $10 and can go up to $24! Most items are small portions so ask your waiter/waitress! Order wisely or you'll end up with a huge bill at the end and may still be hungry!"
OvenBird,5,"Wow. OvenBird is delicious. I love tapas, and our server gave some pretty great recommendations. The beef fat candle was the coolest thing I've ever seen. I had too much bread with it, but I managed to have room for: scallops, harvest vegetables, duck, Peruvian chicken, and beef. The vegetables had this orange sauce that was just perfect. I don't usually like beets, but I gobbled them up because of how good the sauce was. The Peruvian chicken was a little dry, but that's the nature of chicken. The duck, scallops, and beef were very good. The scallops paired well with the arugula, but the sauce was spicier than expected. In terms of dessert, I would highly recommend the chocolate cake and cranberry crumble. My only complaint is the smoke coming out of the oven. I was coughing from the smoke, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying a delicious meal."
OvenBird,5,"Best meal I had in a long time! I went on a friends recommendation. The ambiance is great, I sat at the bar as I was alone. I got there early so no issues with grabbing a seat. I took the bartender recommendation and ordered the mushroom with egg and beef shoulder with root vegetables. This was plenty of food for me as I was very satisfied. Both dishes were flavorful and well seasoned. The beef was cooked properly to a good mid rare. These 2 dishes complimented each other.There were a few other items I will have to go back and try."
OvenBird,5,"Came here for Restaurant Week 2019 and everything I had was excellent!All the ingredients were fresh, delicious, and each dish tasted amazing. And the tapas style is great because you can share/try a little bit of everything!I especially loved the Deviled Eggs & the Beef Shoulder. I could wax poetic about the food but I think the pictures speak for themselves."
OvenBird,5,"The atmosphere:We came here on a Saturday night, were able to make reservations online pretty easily. It was raining, so we had to sit inside, but the outside patio looked absolutely beautiful. We sat at the bar and got to watch a chef make the various appetizers from there, pretty cool to watch. The inside is decorated really well, and the kitchen is half open so you can see the pizza oven and a few chefs working. The food: We were pretty hungry after having to skip lunch, so we ordered quite a bit of food. Deviled eggs - so so good. Absolutely must order. Their addition of Romesco sauce or these is genius, adds such a nice tang to them. Tomato Salad- fresh tomatoes with some balsamic vinegar, corn, okra, and peas on top. Again, a must try. Chef inspired paella - this wasn't my favorite dish after going to Spain recently and eating paella there quite a bit, but for what's available here, it wasn't bad. Gulf fish - absolutely perfect. Fresh tasting, with a really good tangy sauce to it. I believe the sauce was sherry based. Loved the bacon addition to the dish. Churros- not my favorite, just alright. Peach cobbler - DELICIOUS. Served warm in a cute jar with the crust pieces on top. Price: this place is pricey, but in my opinion very worth it. You can tell they they use great ingredients, and a lot of time is put into each dish. I think this is a perfect spot for a date night, expect to pay at lestThe service: Really great staff, from the people that sit you down to the waiters. Big shout out to Caroline for taking care of us that night!"
OvenBird,5,Excellent experience at OvenBird during Birmingham Restaurant week. The food was nothing short of delicious. The blistered okra won us over and I'm usually not a fan of okra. The fish was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. The ambiance was great. Nice for date night or just getting together with a group of friends in the patio. Will definitely go back to try other dishes and to get more of the okra.
OvenBird,3,"We came here for girl's night. The service was not great. Our server Sam was not friendly nor did he check up on us. You could actually say be was rude at times. Some dishes were good, others so-so. Would I comeback based solely on service? Likely not. So many better options in Birmingham now."
OvenBird,4,"Just a heads up, this place doesn't advertise it much but it is a small plate restaurant. The idea is that you order 4-8 small plates for the entire table, and everyone shares their food. I think this is an interesting note to know when choosing to go here.First off, the atmosphere is top notch. They have dumped tons of heart and soul into renovating this old industrial building. The outside is just as pretty as the inside though. Every dish is cooked over a wood fire. No gas fire here; just rustic, natural cooking. I had a beautifully crafted dish, and m date had the beef. The beef.. I have never tasted anything like it before. I am the average red-blooded America . So I have eaten tons of beef. So I want weight to follow my words I. Saying that it was immaculately spiced. I can't even begin to catagorize it. And the seafood was just as amazing. Make sure to look over the menu before you go. This may not be the local lunch stop, but it is quite a treat."
OvenBird,4,"Love this restaurant, truly one of Birmingham's culinary gems.  Local/regional ingredients with a Spanish, Portuguese or Argentinian flair and cooked over local hardwoods.  I've dined here half a dozen times and have never been disappointed.  My guest and I dined on Spanish themed charcuterie, a local heirloom tomato salad and a whole wood-fire roasted gulf fish finished with a chimichurri rub.  Great deserts, cocktails and a terrific wine selection await your arrival too."
OvenBird,4,The restaurant is very pretty and I loved the ambience.  I came for dinner and sat at the bar.  Staff was super courteous and helpful on making suggestions. Portion sizes are small so I ordered both their braised octopus and winter green salad. The octopus was well done but the sauce that went with it did not suit the dish imo. The salad was pretty bitter and think it would have tasted better with more than 2 prices of orange on there.  Lastly we had the7 layer strawberry cake which was smaller than I imagined for 7 layers but it was delicious.  I went with friend who had alcohol and that seemed to be better than their food.
OvenBird,5,"One of my favorite restaurants in Bham! The space has lots of windows, yet manages to feel cozy and intimate - as if you're visiting a friend's (beautiful) home. The warm lighting, exposed brick, and rugs make the space feel really chic. Food was phenomenal. Keep in mind they are a tapas style restaurant. Between two people, getting 4-5 plates (2 small plates and 2 ""entrees"" or larger plates) is just about right. Highly recommend the beef fat candle(I know it sounds a little weird, but trust me on this) and paella, which are staples on the menu. The bacalao (salted fish, potatoes, and truffle oil) was definitely one of the highlights of our meal. The pork shoulder complex was flavorful - the meat complemented the earthy purple potato and delicata squash perfectly. The small plate/tapas style set up allows you to experience the diversity of offerings on the menu without stuffing yourself full."
OvenBird,1,"What started out as an awesome night turned into a nightmare. I've been a vegetarian for three years and have NEVER had a problem getting something to eat at nice restaurants. So my bf and I decided to check out Ovenbird this week in the spirit of Restaurant week although we didn't order off the special menu. We had heard people rave about the place. Gorgeous restaurant. Very dark and ambient lighting. Tables a little cramped making it loud, but the food should be worth it. Waiter comes and I say I'm a vegetarian what can I eat off the menu. He recommends some things so we ordered an appetizer we could eat. It was good. I was told I could order the VEGETABLE plate so I did. I've ordered this before at other restaurants and knew what to expect and even asked my waiter what veggies came on it. I get the plate and boy it looks good. There's some kind or orange sauce and I mix stuff together to spread it. I eat a green bean, some tomato, and greens.Then I see it. Something that is very not veg. I hand it to my bf to try and he determines its meat. On my veggie plate. So I call the waiter over and tell him there's meat. I'm like maybe some fell in and he comes back and tells me the greens are cooked in meat. At this point I lose my sanity. Don't want anything else and can't trust anything else that comes out of this kitchen. My bf is upset he's finishing his dinner while I sit there. I just wanted to go home. Was too upset to eat anything else and my stomach was upset all night. I just don't understand how a veggie plate gets veggies on it cooked in meat and especially after I alerted my waiter that I'm vegetarian. Just really disappointed in this entire experience. Vegetarians be warned."
OvenBird,3,"I came here on the recommendation of a friend and left with mixed feelings. I will say they have some of the most unique dishes I've ever seen at a restaurant as would be expected due to their commitment to using only an oven to make all of them. Some are truly inspired - the beef fat candle is one of the few menu items that you can describe as legitimately fun. The paella is really good. Their desserts are also phenomenal - the s'more was delicious and their take on creme brulee makes for an amazing show with the hot iron to caramelize the top. So why the low review? Well two things 1) sharing and 2) timing. They recommend getting a number of plates to share which isn't a bad idea but not all of them lend themselves to it. I don't know how you're supposed to share the egg in the mushroom conserva. As for timing we were told the dishes would come out as they are ready and it appears they are all ready at the same time. We got the duck, octopus, paella and conserva all the same time. We couldn't eat them fast enough and once some of them got cold they were a lot less delicious. The duck in particular had some cartilaginous nubs that stood out. It was also hard to appreciate the individual flavors of the dishes when they were presented together like that. I think a smarter kitchen would send out one or two dishes at a time. That being said I'd probably come back here. The atmosphere is nice, the staff is friendly, the drinks are good - just for the price you want an excellent meal and I don't think I got that. If you want to visit for your next special event I'd go and juts have each person order for themselves."
OvenBird,4,"What an amazing surprise as we searched for dinner on our drive to the ATL airport to leave for Cuba. The patio area is elegant and sets the mood with just the view. Once you enter, you are infected by the music, the conversation and the presence of culinary evolution. The service was great, the jamon and serrano rivaled that of Madrid and the braised goat was delicious and tender. We were in a bit of a hurry, but I plan to go again in a couple of months to relax and enjoy such an elegant surprise."
OvenBird,5,We left another excellent meal to get this bone marrow. Ask to have it deglazed with port.  Everything is good. Avocado toast another must have.
OvenBird,5,"This place is true farm to table style of restaurant! Portion is small, but each dish has a good presentation and fresh ingredients! Service is nice too!  Came in as a group, got perfect food and service!"
OvenBird,3,"I am so hurt!! I have been wanting to eat here since they opened and after last night I can honestly say I'm disappointed. I think it's definitely over hyped. My mom and I shared four small plates and I only enjoyed one. The one I did like was the melon and ham! That's one of my favorite combos so that is a dish I would recommend! I do NOT recommend the deviled eggs, however. I get it. Not everyone can make good deviled eggs. Luckily, our server took that off of our bill! We also got the duck, which was okay but too undercooked for my liking. The other dish we tried was the gazpacho, which I also did not care for but my mom enjoyed! Oh yeah, I also ordered the ""Bruja"" drink to start and while it was very pretty to look at, I did not care for it at all. Our waiter also took that off the bill. Ugh! Probably will not be back."
OvenBird,2,"This place is just alright. If you like unique cuisines, farm to table, etc, you might like this joint. It was just a tad too hipster for me. I was in Birmingham for work and a friend of mine graciously reached out to some of her Birmingham friends and one of them had suggested OvenBird. I figured if the locals like it, I might as well try it out!Since I was there for work, I was solo so I sat at the bar. It honestly took awhile for someone to approach me and when he did, he seemed disengaged, like I was inconveniencing him by even sitting there. I ordered a beer and asked him what was good. Again, he seemed kind of annoyed. I quickly made a decision to get the lamb (honestly nothing on this menu stood out to me). The lamb came out quickly and it was almost in like a ""stew"" format. It came in a bowl with a spoon and there was a sunny side egg on top. I did enjoy the taste of the dish. Although it definitely did not fill me up. Another server came by to get my plate and she asked if I'd like anything else. She was way more friendly, attentive and willing to explain other options to me. She mentioned a few appetizers but I opted for the deviled eggs since I saw pics of them on Yelp. She actually didn't recommend them because she felt ""like they were nothing special."" lol! She was right. They were good, but honestly, you get four slices, which is two eggs. I ate them in probably less than two minutes. Again, not very filling. I think all told, my dinner and drink were around $40 and I left still kind of hungry. Coupled with the guy who seemed like he didn't even want to be working there, I just didn't have the best experience."
The Essential,5,"I had eaten here before COVID and loved the atmosphere. It feels like home because of all the floral wall papers and cozy chairs. Since everything is shut down because of COVID my husband and I decided to try one of their meal kits for our anniversary dinner. My favorite meal there is their rigatoni bolognese with chorizo and to my surprise that was one of the take away meal kits. The pasta is homemade which truly makes the dish that much better. The instructions made the preparation a breeze. The meal tasted just like it did in the restaurant and it made me so happy. I would highly recommend grabbing a pot pie, meal kit, or even bread from their takeaway menu for a sweet night in with your significant other (or friends after COVID). Make sure to order your meal online 24 hours in advanced to when you need it! While you're ordering your to go meals, grab some of the pastries by Bandit."
The Essential,5,"The Essential organized a night where they provided free dinners to Healthcare Workers and Restaurant Industry Workers. While they are currently not serving pick-up/take-out/curbside service during the COVID-19 pandemic, they are selling pasta kits as well as pastries from The Essential and Bandit via their website. They provided one of these pasta kits free of charge to us on that night in addition to some extra goodies from other local businesses. The pasta kit included two servings of homemade, fresh bucatini and their mushroom alfredo sauce. With a quick swim in some boiling water and saute on the stove, the pasta and sauce came together super easily and was beyond delicious. I always forget how epic fresh pasta is compared to dry, and the bucatini did not disappoint. I sincerely appreciate them organizing this donation to us, and cannot wait to be back to visit both of their establishments. I have also stopped in for a cup of coffee and a pastry at the Essential and enjoyed a to-go order of their bolognese during a busy night on call at the hospital. The Essential never disappoints at providing excellent service and delicious food. Their owner, Kristen Hall, has an intention of ""making small things with great love,"" and this gesture simply exemplified that and made my day. Thanks again!"
The Essential,5,"could not have been any more pleased. With a pop-up pick up, we grabbed a chicken sandwich and a burger for the two of us this past Saturday night. WOW was it soooo good, buns are fresh made, the preparation is excellent, fresh ingredients and such a great taste. And topped it off with a strawberry fresh made dessert---I mean it was so so good. And we all appreciate you working through this, your can-do spirit means a lot. Thank you The Essential....you are just that, Essential."
The Essential,4,"I've been wanting to try The Essential for a long time and finally got to! I went for lunch on a Friday, which was relatively crowded but there aren't many tables inside. My one star off comes from how close together the tables are. You are a few inches from the table next to you which makes for a very loud and less than intimate place for conversation. Other than the table situation, my experience was great! I had the brussel sprout salad which had shaved brussel sprouts, grilled chicken, hard boiled egg, feta cheese, and bacon. It was delicious and very filling. My friend got one of the pasta dishes which she said was very good. We also split fries. They were a little thicker than I typically like but perfectly cooked. I think the prices are pretty fair for the ambience and quality. It's between $10-20 per person, maybe more with drinks. Everything seemed to be made with fresh ingredients and with care. They have a very cool bar that serves cocktails and coffee. We finished lunch with a cappuccino that we both enjoyed. I would love to try some of their cocktails on another visit. The service was great too! Attentive and nice without being too overbearing. I would love to try this restaurant again, especially in warmer months to sit out on their lovely patio."
The Essential,4,"I came here for lunch and ordered the Essential Hash. This dish came in a big bowl. Potatoes and bell peppers topped with a fried egg. I enjoyed the lime flavor that the potatoes had and the crispiness of the potatoes mixed with the gooeyness of the fried egg. The atmosphere was nice. Tables were limited as it was a little chilly to be sitting inside. It was pretty loud inside, so I felt like I had to yell to talk to the person in front of me. Service was good. Portions were ok, quality was good."
The Essential,5,"I have visited The Essential three times in the past 3 months. The service, the food and the atmosphere are deserve 5 stars! Their pasta is absolutely amazing. All of their pasta is made in house, and you can really tell. My favorite dish I've had was definitely their Octopus Pasta (I do not recall the exact name). It was the most uniquely delicious pasta I have ever had! If you have never been to The Essential, you are missing out on a special experience."
The Essential,4,Came for coffee and to try this Nutella pop tart Tuesday afternoon. The place is nestled right on Morris Ave which a cute outdoor patio. We walked into the restaurant and were not greeted by anybody which was semi confusing.. do we sit ourselves? Do we wait? No clue so after a few minutes I got the bartenders attention and she told us we could order at the bar and sit wherever if we were just in for coffee. On a friendly scale I'd give her a 4/10 which kind of threw me off. Maybe she was having a bad day but either way the place was too pretty for that.   We were also one of the only customers there so yea basically service was a definite let down. The pop tart came first which was a little odd. You'd think it would just come all together. Either way we cut into it and it was cold! I don't know why I imagined it warmed at least. The flavor was great- how can you go wrong with Nutella? The pastry dough was also good (I'm sure it would have been better warm though :)). The outside edges definitely were sparse with Nutella but there was plenty in the center to make everybody happy.  Pop tart 7/10 Then the coffee hit the table. I had a double espresso and it was perfect. Smooth and silky with a very pleasant aftertaste and very little bitterness which was very nice for an espresso. 10/10 Will definitely be back for the coffee! & maybe a pop tart to go to warm up at home! Either way super cute place and worth the visit! They now have a pasta happy hour so I may check that out next :)
The Essential,3,"This is a great great place, however the major, and I mean major setback for this place is the loudness of their music.Having visited similar venues in European town (yes, that's feel), this place would rank right up there if it weren't for the loudness of the music.Having been there numerous times, and with different friends, they all agreed with me.The food and service is superb, and hands down it's flavorful.This place is deal for breakfast and lunch."
The Essential,5,"This is a review for dessert only (although I have also eaten lunch at The Essential and it was also 5 star worthy). We arrived at about 9:15 on a Saturday evening and just wanted dessert. We chose to sit on the patio rather than wait for a table (only quoted a 15 minute wait or was offered seating at the bar as well). We came specifically for the carrot cake, but they had sold out for the day! So sad! We chose to order the Apple Crumble Tart and the Butter Croissant Ice Cream. Both were excellent!!"
The Essential,5,"I can't believe that it took me so long to try this place. I should have gotten here sooner.It's super clean and tidy. The service is exceptional. The menu is creative and full of delicious things. The portions are in line with the prices/quality, and everything that I had was delicious.Started with the frittelle. Soft, savory, and covered with grated manchego. I could eat this all day. Ordered the lamb shoulder confit. It came piled high with a variety of grilled/charred peppers and okra on a layer of cucumber creme fraiche. The creme fraische was delicious, the lamb was falling apart and tender, and some combination of sesame seeds and other spices on it gave it an amazing texture. Really good. Finished up with the butter croissant ice cream and a shot of espresso. The toasted croissant bits in the bowl put it over the top. The espresso was perfectly drawn and couldn't have been better. I also ordered 2 nutella pop tarts to go for later. Haven't eaten them yet, but they're nutella pop tarts...how can they not be amazing?Long story short, this place delivers. High quality, creative and delicious food. Super friendly and efficient service and a chill atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit."
The Essential,5,"I loved this place prior to them rebranding from feast and forest to what's now known as, The Essential ! I only had the chance to eat here once for brunch when it was Feast and First . I loved it! I also loved that they offered baked goods made fresh in house.  My first visit , I enjoyed a nice brunch with my mom on a Saturday.  Unfortunately, I don't recall what we ordered since it's been awhile BUT I do remember leaving very satisfied with the food and the service.  The previous location wasn't a big space at all ;pretty similar to the current location off of Morris Ave. Their new location space is perfectly located with a warm , welcoming and cozy backdrop! I was able to dine  in for coffee and granola for an early breakfast before work after dropping a friend off at the airport.  I could tell that everything I ordered was  made with a lot of care and attention to detail. It's the little things! It was not crowded . I sat in and really took advantage of the nice ambiance it offers all while enjoying my delicious mocha and hearty granola oatmeal. It was such a treat!  I never get to enjoy this type of breakfast experience during the weekday ,  so this really did my mind and soul good. A lot of GOOD!Warning! If you're not careful,  you might break your leg or foot walking on Morris Ave ; however if you do ,  I think it's well worth it  just to experience all The Essential has to offer! They are open for lunch and dinner in their new location . I plan on getting to lunch and/dinner here soon. Looking forward to exploring more of their food and drink menu!"
The Essential,5,"Having never been, a couple of friends and I stopped by for a early Sunday brunch to eat and catch up. We were seated immediately and were approached by a very nice waiter who helped us out. Everything on the menu looked amazing and even at a affordable price. I decided to go with a stack of blueberry pancakes and a cup of coffee. As we waited for our food, we talked and noticed the very hipster and indie vibe going on which we enjoyed immensely. Our food came out soon after we ordered and we dived in. I was extremely pleased with my pancakes as they were sweet but not too much that would be sickening. We all were very happy with our meal and service. This is definitely one of the best brunch experiences I have had in Birmingham."
The Essential,4,One of the best breakfast places in b'ham. Finally cool enough outside to enjoy the patio. Scrambled egg salad is a good choice. Be sure to ask about specials and take a 'pop tart' home.
The Essential,4,"My husband and I stopped by the Essential for brunch this past Saturday when we were visiting Birmingham for the weekend. We really enjoyed our brunch. The restaurant is small but really charming (do you love a wallpaper? Because I love a wallpaper and The Essential has some charming wall paper!), and the service was great. We arrived before 10 (maybe 9:30?) Saturday morning, and we got one of the last tables inside (they were seating outside, but only table had taken them up on it as it was quite chilly outside - February 1). They don't take reservations, and the restaurant stayed full as long as we were there (when we left after 10, there were people waiting for tables at the entrance). We both had coffees (good). My husband had the salmon toast with a side of eggs, which he enjoyed. I had the scrambled egg salad, which I LOVED. What a smart, healthy, but still totally tasty idea? Scrambled eggs (still soft - overcooked scrambled eggs are such a pet peeve of mine, but these were perfect!), crispy bacon, crunchy croutons - but on GREENS?! Loved it. Would eat it again. Might be inspired enough to try it at home as well! A lovely brunch! Street parking was a little difficult to come by, but a meal well worth checking out!"
The Essential,3,"I came here to eat for the first time last weekend after hearing Cayo Coco Rum Bar next door would be close to an hour wait. The Essential is ""essentially"" connected to Cayo and the Pilcrow which makes it convenient when you have to change your plans. I was seated at the bar which I actually kind of prefer since service is much faster. To drink, the bartender recommended a sweet cocktail so I got the Morris Avenue Mai Tai. It's made with campesino aged rum, dry curacao, peanuts from next door, and lime. I liked it, and it tasted similar to many other drinks I've had just with a twist. It must be the curacao that I instantly recognized. To eat, I ordered the Brussel Sprouts Cobb Salad. It took awhile for them to make, but once I got it I was so excited to finally be able to eat. It was just okay, not something I think I would order again. The brussel sprouts were finely chopped, and seemed like cabbage when it was cut this way. I prefer the traditional way when they are cut in half. It was topped with chicken, egg, and bacon. The toppings were good, but I would have liked a dressing or vinaigrette of some sort to add more flavor. Overall, I enjoyed the aesthetics and the atmosphere of this place, but would like to see more from their food."
The Essential,4,We went for a team lunch. The men opted for burgers and thoroughly enjoyed it. I opted for a vegetarian pasta and added shrimp to it. It was housemade and yum. The sauce was delicious. The ambiance and service were great.
The Essential,5,"I went here for brunch last week and can't stop thinking about it. There was a wait as was expected on a Saturday afternoon, but they call you by phone, so you can walk around the Morris ave/1st ave area in the meantime. We sat outside which was also nice. The staff are very accommodating, and food service is fairly quick. We stuck with water and coffee to drink. The coffee is served with rock sugar which is very cute if nothing else. They also have standard brunch drinks, beer, and fresh OJ.For our meals we had the biscuit sandwich and eggs Benedict. The biscuit was very good, but unfortunately they were out of sausage at the time and substituted bacon. Still good, but I was looking forward to their house made sausage. The eggs Benedict, however, was one of the best I've ever had. The English muffin is made in house! Eggs were cooked perfectly. If I go back I would definitely go for this again!"
The Essential,5,"One of my absolute favorite spots in Birmingham.  Their fresh, handmade pastas, soups, and sandwiches cannot be beat.  I've been multiple times for lunch and brunch, and now I desperately need to go for dinner!I ordered the Burger, and it's one the best in Birmingham.  Perfectly juicy, perfectly topped, and served with super crispy fries.The house-made pastries are also a draw.  I usually can't leave without a poptart or some cookies."
The Essential,4,"Food was alright.I would rank it 3 stars based on food alone but am giving it 4 stars because of the ambience, good service, and location right along Morris.Had a girl's night here and all of us felt disappointed in the food. Flavor was weak to the point where none of us felt we wanted to finish our food. We all ordered different types of pasta so maybe that's a weak aspect of their menu..."
The Essential,5,"An excellent addition to Bham that is a European-style restaurant. I enjoyed having brunch here with my wife for the new year. As far as layout for a smaller place, The Essential does it well with a bar area as soon as you walk in, many other tables, and a beautiful outside patio area. Compliment that patio with it being located out by the historic cobblestone street of Morris Avenue, and you've got a great atmosphere when weather is nice. Be sure to also check or the catchy and trendy decor. The food and service was excellent even for a busy morning like New Years Eve. We were greeted with a smile and our orders were prompt and prepared well. My wife and I split the ""pop tart"" while waiting on our orders and it was delicious. I ordered the Essential Hash and my wife got the quiche with salad. The hash consisted of all of my favorite things: potatoes, sausage, egg, onions, peppers, salsa, and even pickles! I tried a bite of my wife's quiche and salad and I also give it five stars. The coffee was also good; I've had a little better but that won't let me go down a star on this one. All in all, I highly recommend this place, and I will definitely return sometime soon. I'd love to catch lunch or dinner next time, and maybe catch a day in the Spring to enjoy the patio."
EastWest,5,"On this Thank You Thursday, I'd to thank your establishment for a great experience in renting your upstairs venue and for being a great restaurant. It was perfect for our event. People raved about the food and our hostess for the night was so on top of things. Y'all are my top 3 places to dine in downtown Birmingham and I just wanted to show you guys some love. Keep doing what y'all are doing. I'm dreaming of the korean fried cauliflower and west wings. If my fellow yelpers need a good take out option try them, you will not be disappointed especially with their wings and cauliflower! I can't wait till things become safer out there with the virus so I can dine with y'all again. Until then stay safe and well. Thanks for being great."
EastWest,5,"Delicious Asian Fusion in downtown Birmingham--got the fried cauliflower, west wings, and spring rolls for an appetizer which were all very good and pretty good serving sizes (there were 6 of us and it was plenty). At the table for entrees we had the ribeye, Kobe burger, spicy garlic shrimp, lobster crab cakes, and the tonkatsu pork chop. All were great--crab cakes and pork chop were exceptional! Would definitely recommend the Mr West cocktail if you like a bit of kick to your drink. On the specials menu for dessert was a praline bread pudding...it was absolutely delicious whether you like bread pudding or not. Get it if they have it on the menu for the night!"
EastWest,5,Wing Wednesday is my favorite time to visit EastWest. I finally went tried their brunch and was not disappointed. The fried rice seemed to be a favorite; the flavor combos from the sauces were astonishing. The hot chicken & waffles were oh so good. The plating was beautiful; maybe it's just the bubbles from the bubble waffle!! You can't go wrong during dinner. I've tried just about everything on the menu. The wings are an absolute must as well as the fried cauliflower.
EastWest,5,"EastWest is great on all fronts: food, drinks, location, atmosphere. It is the perfect location for a date, birthday dinner, or even casual weeknight dinner. The pricing is fair, with a wide variety of meals to choose from. I had the Korean fried cauliflower, soft shell crab bao buns, and spring rolls. Every single one of these items was delicious, and I can't wait to back and try even more menu items! North, south, EastWest...this place is great in any direction."
EastWest,5,"I'm really upset that I haven't been here earlier because it's incredible. As a vegetarian I always scope out the menu before going, and basing my restaurant choices off of that in Birmingham is a bad choice. They do a vegetarian bowl that is off menu that is one of the top 5 veggie mains I've had in my life. The hostess, Lisa, was as calm and collected even though they were in a heavy dinner rush on New Year's Eve. Our waitress (her name escapes me) was super attentive. Once I let her know I was a vegetarian, she checked to make sure That anything that could be an allergen or something I wouldn't possibly eat was in the dish I ordered. It's rare you see that. My husband had the ahi tuna wonton tacos and the short rib main. I had the off menu veggie bowl. We both had the bread pudding. I'm not a huge sweets fan, but the bread pudding is FANTASTIC. Do yourself a favor and go get lots of good food at EastWest."
EastWest,5,"Ok we are always down for Asian food and this is the new favorite. We happened to go on a Tuesday and it's tapas Tuesday with drinks and tapas marked down. The drinks were amazing!!!We ordered multiple things to try (at $4 a plate why the heck not). My favorites were the duck nachos, wings, and pork belly bao bun. The nachos are served on crispy wontons. I was afraid they'd be greasy but not at all! The wings fell off the bone and although quite messy, super worth it!  I'll be back this week for my birthday and will order all the same things because they are just that good."
EastWest,5,"Came here with a group of 6 on a Wednesday night. We really wanted to hit wing Wednesday and called ahead to see if we could get reservations or what the wait time was. They don't do official reservations but I think sometimes they'll put you on the wait line. The wait was about 45 minutes from 7- around 745. Long wait but totally worth it.Everyone ordered a round or two of wings and I also  ordered an orange beef entree. It comes with cube sliced beef, carrots, kimchi, and rice. I loved the dish don't get me wrong, but I think there could be some really great improvements to it! For 16 dollars, they don't scam you on the beef portion. Although it comes in a small bowl, it's loaded with beef cooked to perfection! The real downside of the dish was that it was overly sauced and all of my rice became over covered in sauce. The dish was very enjoyable at the beginning but wasn't as great towards the end. Possibly add more rice and lessen the sauce that accumulated at the bottom of the bowl.The wings. Wow they were good. If you're here on wing Wednesday and not getting messy with the wings then what are you doing!!!Service. Super nice, quick on taking our orders, quick on drink refills. Awesome service! I will definitely be back and update my review if I like the other entrees! I'm only giving it a 4 star for now because of the orange beef but the wings nearly pull it to a 5!"
EastWest,4,"Not sure how I haven't rated this place yet! It is a great spot for dates or hanging out, though I do wish they had more seating. If you time it wrong, you will be waiting a while! But that's a good problem for them to have. The staff are always nice, though depending on how busy it is, it may take them some time to get back to you. The food is, simply, very tasty! I love the bao buns. I get the pork belly, as it is just the right mix of the light, fluffy buns and great tasting pork. The cauliflower and the short ribs are a must as your appetizers. This past trip, we tried the chocolate torte. That was very good, and a chocoholic like me appreciated it. I'm not a huge fan of the nachos, though my wife loves them. There are usually weekly specials running as well, giving you an option to try something new that isn't normally on the menu. Looking forward to coming back soon."
EastWest,4,"Came here with some friends for dinner after having heard good things. For appetizers, we had the spring rolls and duck nachos. Spring rolls were crisp and tasty. I liked the smoky flavor that they had too. Duck nachos were unique:  duck, fried wanton wraps as the chips, and kimchi queso. Overall, I liked this dish. It had Asian flavors in it despite it being nachos (cheese isn't in Asian cuisine), and it was tasty.The entree I ordered was the special of the week - Red Grouper. I usually stay away from seafood if it is in a landlocked location and also because they usually skimp on the portions. However, this dish was quite memorable. A decent portion of soft, flavorful grouper over risotto and asparagus, topped with a creamy, sweet and a little spicy coconut curry of some sort. This is the quantity and quality I would expect for $30. I liked this place better than Bamboo on 2nd (close by). The wait on a Friday was quite longer than we were initially told, though, and the food took a long while to arrive too. Overall, a good place to eat."
EastWest,4,"So, one my friends suggested EastWest because of the awesome deal on the West Wings on Wednesdays. Sounded like a great plan and a great plan it was!!! I went right on over to Yelp to see what my friends had to say plus other Yelpers. I arrived around 5pm and there were only those who were employed there. I checked to make sure they were opened. I realized that I do get off earlier than most. I decided to sit at the bar and Mr. Johnathan was very attentive. I had the 2nd Ave Sour, very refreshing. Great reviews on the West Wings, extra crispy. They were fantastic with my side of Curly Fries. Friends arrived and we were seated in a booth where David checked on us several times throughout. I had to end my evening with the bread pudding and it did not disappoint. I will go back and try other items on the menu but the West Wings hit the spot for now!!!"
EastWest,5,"Swung by to meet some friends for dinner here on a Friday night. Was fortunate enough to find street parking right in front of the restaurant, I've had trouble parking for downtown restaurants before.Couple things to start off: the decor and ambience is great. It's great for a date night or meeting with friends. The venue itself kinda makes you want to hang out. Secondly the service was good and pretty fast. I arrived later than my friends but my food came out moments after theirs. Everything that came out looked delicious. The spring rolls were the best I've had, they were so light and not greasy at all. I'm also not huge on veggies, but the Korean Fried Cauliflower is delicious. It packs a lot of flavor without being overly heavy. I had the spicy garlic shrimp as my entree and it did not disappoint. So much flavor with a nice kick from the Thai Chili's. Will be back for sure."
EastWest,5,"EastWest is one of my favorite restaurants in town. The service is excellent and the food is even better. They have the best wings in town, and I know my wings! But today I will review the old fashioned. They use benchmark whiskey and it is perfection. I always say keep it simple. Please come check them out and let me know what you think."
EastWest,4,"We have had this place bookmarked for a while, but due to some fellow yelpers having less than stellar visits, we've postponed for a while. We recently purchased a gift card, which would ensure we would give this place a try. We arrived on a Thursday at 5PM (when they opened). I wanted to get there early because we had an evening event to attend, and I didn't want to deal with long waits/lines. That wasn't a problem, because the entire time we were there, 5PM - 6:15, there were only two other tables that were occupied. Maybe crowds come later in the evening, or on the weekend, but I was pleased with the service we received.My husband and I wanted to try several of the small plates, so we ordered several of those instead of entrees.Duck Nachos : my favorite! The duck, cheese, toppings, and wontons were so unique. My mouth is watering thinking about that. Cauliflower: decent. Not my favorite, but we did enjoy the sauce that was coated on the cauliflower.Wings: Were pretty good. But I'm not a wing connoisseur like my husband. Read his review for more details. The soft shell crab bao bun was also delicious. It was my first time having bao buns, so I was pretty impressed. I'm sure we'll be back here again (we've already purchased another gift card)."
EastWest,5,"My husband and I had the chance to try this place for brunch on a Saturday when we were finishing up our Christmas shopping. Yes, I always shop at the last minute. We had heard so many great things about this place and they all proved to be true. Atmosphere was great and the food was so good. My husband had the burger and I have to admit I had a little food envy! Mine was great but his was so amazing. It made me wish made I'd  ordered the burger as well. Try it if you haven't already and if you have...go again!!"
EastWest,5,"EastWest is one of my new favorite places to get wings. On Wednesdays, they have half off wings which cost around $5 for about 6 wings. As you can imagine, the crowd during the dinner hours is insane. Waits can range from 15 mins to an hour even near closing time. The front of the store does not have much room for the large amount of guests that are waiting for a table, but within 20 minutes, my party of 5 got seated The time I went, I ordered two orders of wings for a total of 12. I've never had wings that were smoked and then fried before, but man these were something else. The smoky taste with the crunchy, saucy bite took me to a place I'd never been before! I've heard these wings were amazing and I didn't believe it, but I definitely understand why now. Alongside the great food came great service. I have nothing to complain about because this entire experience was eye-opening. I'm sure next time I come I'll order something other than their wings, but it'll be hard considering how delicious and addictive these things are."
EastWest,4,"Eastwest where ya at....where ya at....where ya at!?!?!? This is easily becoming the quick go to for a quick dinner before a turn up night! It's super modern offering a great decor & craft cocktails. The location is great. You're literally walking distance from several bars, lounges, hotels, & restaurants. Plenty of shareable options which is great for groups or just plain greedy people like me! My favs you ask? Duck nachosCauliflower Bao buns (soft shell crab & pork belly) West wingsEast75 is my drink (I sub Tequila for gin) Overall this is definitely a spot I could easily frequent."
EastWest,5,"The first thing I have to say about this place is that the service was absolutely awesome and our server was amazing and from the looks of it everybody seemed awesome. The vibe was so cool and I hate I can't remember our waitresses name but she was super dope and I can't wait to visit again. We were only stopping in for a quick bite before a concert so we ordered appetizers and a drink.  We tried the West wings and the spring rolls. OMG the wings we're Smokey,crispy, sweet and tangy all in one and the spring rolls were good but not the best I've had but still good. I so wanted to try the soft shell crab steamed bao bun but they were out of the crab so we went for the pork belly instead and it did not disappoint us at all. I'm so bummed that I can't remember the drink that I had but it was the special drink of the night so maybe that helps. Please please please go and try this place and I can't wait to visit them again."
EastWest,5,"Came here for a birthday dinner and couldn't say anymore good things about this place. Great service and great food. It was wings Wednesday so half off wings. The wings were so tasteful and very smokey....so Smokey you would have to call Smokey the bear. I recommend the short rib baos, lots of flavor .Got the Chinese nachos. These are one my favorite appetizers to get here. It has a some sweetness to it that I adore. Kobe burger was also amazing, it was so moist and juicy that meat sweat soaked the buns. I wanted to try out the tonkotsu  pork with rice since I wanted to compare it the one I had in japan. It is almost on the same level as the one in japan but I wish the meat could be a little bit thicker. Overall the tonkotsu was crispy, the way I like it. And bathroom was clean, I wish they had automatic sinks and towel dispenser."
EastWest,5,"Where to BEGIN! I am in Birmingham on a work trip, staying downtown. Walked upon this place (also saw yelp reviews) and thought let's try it. Claudia was our waitress, I wish we could just take us with everywhere. Her recommendations were everything!! We decided to order a few dishes to share. We started with the wings, Claudia's first recommendation (must get) finished them in seconds. I'm surprised I even got a picture. 100% amazing. Than came the pork Bao Bun, it was big so we cut in half, highly recommend and I'm not even a bun fan but this was finger licking good. Than came the Ribeye, wow.... I hate green beans at restaurants because they aren't fresh most of the time, HOWEVER these were FRESH and to die for!!  The ribeye itself was worth every penny. Medium and perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth. Just WOW. We were stuffed.... however wanted to hear the dessert menu since we were 3 for 3 in major food wins. Claudia recommendation once again, the BREAD PUDDING. I'm only here for a week but I will be popping back in for a TO-GO pudding because it was divine. Thanks for being AWESOME!"
EastWest,5,"My husband and I celebrated our 5th year anniversary here and we were absolutely delighted with our evening. Service was excellent; all waitstaff is extremely attentive and you will not feel like you are being ignored or having to constantly track down your server. Definite A+ for that! Now, the food. I wanted to order one of everything off this menu, but since I'm not a millionaire and only have one stomach, we settled for an appetizer of the famed duck nachos, which has an accurate reputation of being delicious as hell. The duck has a wonderful, exotic taste to it, and the kimchi queso is so complimentary (and something I wouldn't mind learning how to make at home for that next dinner party). In addition to our main entrees, we also ordered the pork belly bun and the short rib bun. The short rib was easily the better of the two, though both were good. I think the pork belly was just a lot of meat for that tiny bun. For the main course, I ordered the lobster crab cakes and husband ordered the Kobe burger. The burger is actually two slim patties, not one huge thick patty - which is our preference, as overly thick patties can just feel like nothing more than a meat sandwich. Husband enjoyed his, and even ate the onion jam even though he detests all form of onions. The lobster crab cake were absolutely D I V I N E. The risotto was delicious and creamy and paired quite well with the buttery crab cakes. There was also some kind of citrusy slaw/salad that was sprinkled a top the crab cakes and that was so incredible - it added a wonderful tang to compliment the seafood-based flavors. And asparagus is like vegetable candy to me, and it was perfectly cooked and tender. I really wanted to try that banana creme brulee that I've seen in some of the menu photos, but alas 1) it was not being served this evening and 2) I could not/should not have eaten any more as I was completely full (but not miserable). They did have a gluten-free chocolate torte, a strawberry cheesecake, and one other dessert I cannot recall. The ONLY complaint I have - it gets LOUD up in here. We arrived around 6:30 and it was at a reasonable restaurant din, but by the time we left it was noisy and packed - likely as you'd expect any trendy spot in Birmingham to be on a Friday night. With so many people clamoring around the bar we felt like we needed to make ourselves scarce. Though I understand the elevated volume, I'm a little past my bar hopping days and really would have preferred a quieter, more intimate dining experience. At times I could not hear what my husband was saying right next to me. But, like I said, the noise was only amping up toward the end of our experience, and in no way did it ruin anything. Just something to consider if you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner out. And maybe go on any other night but a Friday."
LaLas Kitchen Mobile Food Trailer,5,One of the best black owned food trucks I had ever. Cooked to order and it's seasoned like I'd do it. Can't wait to have it again.
LaLas Kitchen Mobile Food Trailer,5,"If you want one the world's best egg roll, roll on over to Lala's Kitchen. You will definitely be glad that you did."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"This was the first restaurant that I have been to amidst the covid-19 pandemic. They were not doing valet obviously and they were taking temperatures before you could enter. That made me feel really comfortable and on top of that they only had about four tables in each room and they were constantly sanitizing and cleaning. This was my first time finally eating here and I was really excited. Our server, Amy, was extremely knowledgeable and had been working there for 8 years. I decided on the rabbit ragout because, duh it sounds amazing! We ran into a little problem because it took over an hour for our food to come out. I nicely explained it to Amy and immediately the manager came over (Mark I believe) and told us that our meal would be taken care of. I was so thoroughly impressed with the swift response. In fact, Mark was not the only one to apologize but the events coordinator came over and took the time out to apologize as well. They have some of the best customer service that I know of. I will definitely be coming back because the dishes are superb, the restaurant is spotless, and on top of that, the service is impeccable."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"Ohmygosh, the wine bar out back...this is my new fa-voh-rite restaurant & bar.  And why am I sharing?  I kinda want this to stay under the radar.Service is personal and fast.Wine is at retail plus a 20% corkage fee (which I do need to say is a little steep for corkage fees).Selection is plentiful.Food is same as in the restaurant out front. And man is it tasty.Portions are not huge but reasonable.And not overpriced.I had the stuffed mushroom app ($10/ four....which is again, a leetle steep), the pasta special.  My buddy had the ahi special which I guess was great cuz all he did was eat once it hit the bar top.  We split a bottle of Freakshow cab....one of my go-to bottles.Gianmarco's is on the list for future return on next trip to B'ham."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants, and I visit at least once a week. My favorite item is the Bucatini Carbonara. It has a fried egg on top. It is so yummy. I also like to wind down after my meal with their cappuccino, which is so underrated!!! The service is always friendly and quick. There is also parking out front and on the side. For dinner and sometimes at lunch during the holidays, there is complimentary valet parking. We always go around lunch time (except Monday- no lunch this day). Back to the food- I also like their chopped salad. I always get 1/2 order of the chopped salad because the whole portion will fill you up. They give generous portions of food, so most of the time I have a to go box. The lasagna is also very yummy. The latest menu item I tried is the frittata. I wanted breakfast and lunch at the same time, but was craving Gianmarco's. So I was able to satisfy that craving, as it came with a mixed greens salad. This was one of the best frittatas that I have ever had! I was pleasantly surprised.  If you have a large party, it is best to make reservations because they fill up fast."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,3,"I ordered Crusted sea scallops baked in oven served over polenta and spinach with lemon scampi reduction. This was our first visit (review is a year late btw- we visited April 2019). We waited two months for their first available reservation but once we arrived for our scheduled time we still had to wait an excessive amount of time to be seated. Service was mediocre throughout our visit but got even worse towards the end when a clearly ""more important"" table of known customers came in and our server basically disappeared and spent all of his time with them and went to get the manager/owner to also go speak to them. You don't know who we are, how much money we have or how much we are willing to tip yet you totally drop us when they walk in, even though we have ordered, appetizers, drinks, entrees, the full works. We had to ask for someone to come bring our check. The food was fine but the whole experience was overlooked by the terrible service."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Bham.  I love this place for special occasions (like anniversaries and birthdays) but it is also great for a quick lunch or a good date night.  MAKE RESERVATIONS!  My favorite thing here is probably the pear and fig fiocchi pasta purses.  I get it almost every time.  The beef carpaccio is a favorite around town too.  For a special experience, try sitting at the chef's counter so you can watch all of the cooking action going on!  The lunch menu has a few sandwiches, salads, pasta dishes, and main dishes.  I really like going here for lunch and try to get out here as often as possible for a weekday treat with my lovely bride.  The bartenders and the bar area are very nice.  Any time we have eaten here for dinner, the bar area was packed and everyone was seeming very happy and relaxed while they sipped wine or martinis and snacked on appetizers.  My has always enjoyed any mixed drink she has ordered at the table and usually the bartender comes out to the table to see if she liked it!We will DEFINITELY be back soon!"
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"We made reservations in advance for our party of seven. There is no online reservations system so you have to call the restaurant. We came for a work Christmas lunch, and the restaurant was very busy. The complementary parking is great because of the limited and congested parking lot.Our waiter was wonderful. He explained the menu, and gave recommendations in great detail. I was really impressed with the menu and numerous options that were not on today's lunch menu. It really showcased the kitchen's range and flexibility.For my lunch entree, I was steered toward a Scallop with Pasta option. Four huge scallops are seared to perfection. Firm but tender, the scallops were delicious. The spaghetti pasta was cooked just right. A light sauce of wine, olive oil, garlic, and crushed pepper flakes was a great combination. The pepper flakes gave the dish a nice edge. I LOVED it, and definitely recommend."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"This is a cozy, white table cloth, neighborhood, Italian/American restaurant. It is incredibly charming and warm. And yes the food is good and comforting. Prices were reasonable for the most part. There's a mix of affordable pasta dishes, some unique dishes, and classic American elevated dishes if you want to splurge. Prices match what you get. Like all good restaurants in Bham space is limited here. You have to make a reservation, which is good because it is better than waiting forever or being turned down for a table which happens at a lot of places downtown. We were able to make a reservation for 6 at 6:30 pm on the night we needed but we did it 2 weeks in advance. It is very snug in here and really packed. At first it kind of made me nervous but I eventually felt okay and our table and chairs were plenty roomy and comfy. Our waitress was fun and sassy. Service was attentive and prompt. Our waters remained filled. Food came out hot and fresh. I was on an extreme budget this month so I ordered the lasagna which was only $14 and worth every bite. They have valet parking but I parked up the road in the neighborhood. Be considerate and make sure you're not blocking anyone in or messing with anyone's property and you should be fine. All in all I would highly recommend this place for a special night out. We enjoyed celebrating our friend's birthday here."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"SO. GOOOOD! This was our first visit. We weren't able to get reservations, so we went to the wine bar. We got there at 5:10 and all the seats had already been taken. We knew to expect that though. Everyone took their sweet time eating and drinking, so it was around 6:30pm before we finally were sat (again, expected). We ordered wine to drink during the wait, which was fun to window shop all the wine to pass the time.Our server was extremely knowledgeable. She told us all of that days specials, which was like 3 different appetizers, soups, 3 different entrees, and 3 other things. She described each one in great detail which took quite a bit of time. I appreciated her describing all the specials, but it was so much! Made my head spin. My husband and I both ordered caprese salad to start. I ended up just ordering chicken parmesan as my entree, which isn't on the menu, but they will let you order it. My husband ordered the linguini frutta di mare. Both arrived in a reasonable amount of time and were HOT. If you come here for anything, it is definitely the food. Our meals were DELICIOUS!! The red sauce on my chicken parm was the perfect flavor and my husbands dish was perfectly seasoned (small kick of spice). We ended up spending $85 before tip for 2 glasses of merlot, 2 caprese salads, and our 2 entrees. We will definitely be back!"
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"My favorite restaurant in Birmingham. Get the pear ravioli appetizer, fiacchi. The penne vodka with sausage is also great."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,4,"Ok this spot is always a special experience.  The interior is warm, inviting, your grandmother's kitchen/dining room space vibes, which means full of noise, people and very close quarters to each other!  Parking is valet only or you can park in the neighborhood.We made reservations for a large party and we were seated immediately at 6:30 pm during a weekday. Table comes with bread and dipping oil. We ordered the eggplant ivoltini which was very tasty - basically slices of eggplant rolled with ricotta and parmesan in the middle drizzled with marinara.  Also the warm pistachio crusted goat cheese (this is a small portion fyi) - the dish comes with a crusted ball of goat cheese and we halved that sucker into lots of pieces to share amongst us! Our waitress was so nice and accommodated our request for more crostinis to spread the cheese on! This was my fav app! So I wanted to make a basic Italian dish selection and that was the cheese ravioli. Now you know simple and classic dishes shine as expected from places like this and the ravioli did not disappoint! Ya'll I wanted to finish my plate but I was going to get sick if i stuffed another one in my mouth  This was a treat to come here!"
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,3,"Wish 3.5 stars were an optionMade a reservation for my birthday. Showed up on time for the reservation, but we still waited 20/30 mins. Finally seated and our waiter although friendly bombarded us with the daily specials. It was sort of funny but by the end of it we had no idea which dish was which because he never took a breath..he just spewed out like 25 items. So after that I explained I was vegetarian he suggested the fiocchi, baby greens salad and eggplant parm for me and the penne al vodka for my date. We ordered all 4 items because it was my birthday. The fiocchi and baby greens were excellent. The eggplant parm was underwhelming...really mushy and watery. I also ordered a side of spaghetti to go with because the eggplant parm entree only comes with eggplant. Our waiter wasn't the most attentive. We had to wait a while to get more bread and our check. Overall my opinion of Gianmarcos is Fare...good food not great. Prices aren't bad..our check came out to be just under $70 not including tip (we didn't get any alcohol)."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"Had a great time here last night. Was with a group of friends for my birthday dinner. The service was excellent- our waitress was really friendly and nice. The food was amazing, too. We got the goat cheese and eggplant appetizers; they were really good. There was enough for the 6 of us to share, though they're probably more suited for a single person. I got the rigatoni quattro formaggio as my meal, and it was really flavorful! My friends got different pasta dishes and everyone was pleased with their food. For dessert, we got the tiramisu and the bombolini, which were these delicious Nutella-filled doughnuts. Overall, we had a great experience!"
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"I'm surprised I haven't gotten around to reviewing Gianmarco's yet! This is one of my favorite restaurants in Birmingham. I definitely recommend getting a reservation, as this place is ALWAYS packed. But the effort, and the wait, are worth it. The food is superb - I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. The waiters are very attentive. This is, by far, the best Italian restaurant in Birmingham. The atmosphere is great as well. It's cozy and romantic, perfect for a date night. There isn't much parking, but they do offer valet services. That is especially helpful if you come on a rainy day/night visit. If you are going to try coming here for a special occasion, make sure to call and make a reservation in advance. They stay pretty busy."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"We finally made it in to this Birmingham institution a few weeks ago and we pleasantly surprised! When you walk in, the inside does not scream ""fine dining"". Thick carpet, crowded bar area, and decor that does not fit with the ""foodie"" scene. Do not let that fool you, however. The service is pro level; not once did we have to flag anyone down or feel forgotten about. Our server had an incredible knowledge of the menu and specials and was able to make recommendations based on that. We'd been advised to go with the specials, and I would recommend the same. I had a version of a surf and turf, with a wonderfully cooked steak and some head on shrimp. Where the decor might make me pause, the food and the service are the real stars of the show. This is definitely a place we would want to bring our parents or anyone we might be looking to impress. Reservations strongly recommended."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,Small space and tough to get in! Ambience is a little understated and close for the high end quality of the food. Food was amazing. Definitely a high end date night.
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,3,"​Authentic Italian??? Not really!!! Should you care? Probably​ not, since the food at the end is quite good.The 3-star vote is because I cannot stand the plain lack of comfort, privacy​, decor, ambiance​, and aesthetics​. This place feels and looks like a garage! I refuse to further pay such a ​stellar price for dining in a garage. I probably went here for business meetings five times or more, but after all, we decided that the plain lack of everything​ else than the good food nullified​ the pleasure of having it!Anyway. They do propose a ​few authentic Italian ""portate"" but​ those are the most simple ones for which you shouldn't​ bother coming here and pay $$$.The very good dishes are an American revisitation of Italian recipes​ or a whole Americanization of them, which is not a bad thing by itself. In​ the end, it is good food, but, stick with meat dishes. Fish is ok.One thing I very much enjoy every t​ime​ is reading​ their menu!Half of the Italian dish names are brutally misspelled, which is very typical of low-end ""Italian"" places. This is not a low-end Italian restaurant, so, come on guys, I bet you heard of Google!!!Here, ...free consulting:SCALLOPINI / ""scaloppini"".PARMIGANA / ""parmigiana"".PEPPERONCINI / ""peperoncini""MARGARITA / ""margherita""!PROSCUITTO and then PORSCUITTO is ""prosciutto"" (how did you mess up this one!).PARARDELLE / ""pappardelle""CHIAPATTA??? You mean ""ciabatta""??? ...bcz ""chiapatta"" is when you bump somebody with your butt!!!Recommended if you only and exclusively care about having some good food.Absolutely​ not recommended for a nice dinner out with a​ significant other where you'd like some privacy or would enjoy​ a ""nice place""."
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,Didn't have reservations so thought we could sit at the bar if we got there early. We arrived at 5 o'clock on the dot by the time we parked and walked through the door and EVERY seat at the bar was already occupied! We luckily snagged the last high top!The bar tender waited until we were seated and told us all about the specials at one time.
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,One of the best Birmingham has to offer! We did not make reservations so we went to the wine bar in the back at opening (Wine bottles are cheaper here). Listen to the wait staff because the daily specials are very good. I had the ribeye special which was exceptionally done. Our waiter also recommended the peanut butter mousse which was a home run. The cinnamon ice cream was not overpowering and rounded out the flavor of the dessert.
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,4,"We love this restaurant! The only issue we have ever had is getting a table because it's so popular! The traditional Italian is delicious, best in the city. And the grilled meats are wonderful. My husband and I recently split a steak with a side of macaroni and Brussels sprouts. Perfection! Call ahead and make reservations ... you won't be disappointed!"
Gianmarco’s Restaurant,5,"Can't believe I've never been to this restaurant. I received a gift card as a graduation present from someone who thinks this is the best restaurant in Birmingham. We finally decided to make reservations to try it out. We went on a Thursday night. It was actually really busy considering it was a weekday. We got there a little early to check out the cute wine bar in the back. They have a great selection of wine at really reasonable prices. Since we had reservations in the actual restaurant, we didn't stay at the wine bar long; however, I would love to go back and hang out a bit at this place. Once in the restaurant, we were seated right away. The waiter was not far behind. I ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio, which was at the table in no time at all! They give complimentary bread, which is so soft and goes amazing with the olive oil provided. The waiter was super impressive, as he recited about 7 different specials that night without ever missing a beat. For our appetizer we ordered the fried calamari. OMG, delicious. Some places the calamari is over breaded and tough, but not this place. It basically melts in your mouth. They also give you a huge portion. I was full before my main dish was out. I ordered the chef's special, which was stuffed jumbo shells with crab over a bed of spinach and some other amazing stuff. My husband ordered the veal chop Parmesan. Holy moly, we left with food for a week from that dish. It's massive. The food was cooked perfectly. Will definitely be back and highly recommend."
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"Back in February a gentleman friend brought me to Perry's dinner; it was my first visit but he had dined here at least half a dozen times.  His previous experiences had all been very positive and he knew the layout of the restaurant; he made a point of requesting a window table when he made our Open Table reservation and when we arrived we were indeed seated right next to the window.  It was a very classy start to an exceptional dining experience!He ordered for both of us and we ate family-style so we could both enjoy a wider variety of flavors.  Starting us off with the fried asparagus (totally delicious!), for our entrees we had the pork chop (perfectly seasoned and so huge it might have come from a Mastodon rather than a pig!) and the Bone-In New York Strip (beautifully marbled, cooked to perfection and nicely seasoned).Service was excellent - attentive without being obtrusive; our server recommended the Bananas Foster for dessert and it was an outstanding finish to a wonderful meal.The food here is wonderful; I highly recommend dining here whether you choose to go with their (hopefully temporary) curb-side options or the traditional dine-in option (when health conditions permit)."
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"My husband hired a chef to come cook for me, but due to an emergency, the chef was unable to make it. My husband, being the planner he is, ordered us a meal from Perry's. I had never had Perry's before so I was pleasantly surprised! The curbside pickup at Perry's is the most organized one I have seen. The signs cleared showed where to go and our food was brought out to us almost immediately. I like when things run efficiently. My husband ordered the Steakhouse Smorgasbord, which came with three signature appetizers, four entrées, three sauces, and three family style sides. The appetizers were four jumbo grilled shrimp, four crab cake balls, and four bacon wrapped scallops. I tried one of each and they were all good! The entrees included prime sliced New York strip, grilled salmon, center cut sliced filet, and chargrilled chicken. I had the New York strip and center cut and I really liked both meats. My kids ate the chicken and they said it was delicious. My husband enjoyed the salmon. For sides, we had Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, and macaroni and cheese. The clear winner of the sides was the Brussels sprouts! My kids even ate some of the Brussels sprouts and that is out of the ordinary for them. I have the orange vanilla cheesecake in my refrigerator right now because I'm too stuffed to partake in it now. I love how it looks though and I'm confident it will taste just as delightful as the other good I already tried. I will definitely eat at Perry's again. Next time, I hope it is a dine-in dinner."
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"This was only my second time having Perry's. Once a year or so ago and most recently, during the pandemic we are currently experiencing. I ordered online two of their Easter Weekend 3 course meals. Ordering was extremely easy and fast! They offered a variety of choices for a reasonable price.  They even had specials on mimosas and their signature brand wines.  My order consisted of their famous Pork chop, Caesar salad, and chocolate crunch dessert- 16oz prime rib ( medium) wedge salad and butterscotch budino dessert.When I arrived at my scheduled pick up time , there were a few people already waiting.  The process was well executed. When it was my turn, I gave the gentleman my name and he very quickly brought my order out to me . In addition, he thanked me personally by name and told me to enjoy my meal!  I certainly enjoyed every morsel of my meal! There was plenty of food , which made for some great leftovers!  Highly recommend , great food , great curbside service experience!"
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"While this restaurant is a chain it is a little more than just that.  One of their specialty is the Grilled Pork Chop.  My grilled pork chop was just amazing with a double caramelization during cooking sealing a most delectable flavor on the outer crust. Yes, it is a large portion and it is a lot for most, but I enjoyed every bit of it. The chop was accompanied by a small serving of applesauce for the larger piece of the chop as it is carved into three sections table side, but I also opted for the peppercorn gravy as a side topping.  The au gratin potatoes were so cheesy and rich.  Next always gets their steaks. This places knows how to do steak right especially with their different varieties of steak toppers and sauces."
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"I have been wantingto eat here for a long time aardvark finally went to celebrate a birthday. The service was top notch. Our waiter  was constaNtly checking on us and tending to anything we needed. You couldn't have asked for a better waiter.The food is expensive, but well worth it. I got the pork chop and got a second meal from the leftovers. The flavor was excellent. We got deserts  and it was fun to watch them cook them right in front of you.  They tasted great as well. Would happily come ear here again soon."
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"I have been to this restaurant for dinner, and there is not a better steak in town. That's hard to say because there are tons of steak restaurants in Birmingham.I tried this place for lunch because I heard they have a reasonably priced hamburger with high quality beef. my recommendation is if you're going to get this hamburger, make sure you get it medium or medium well. although I felt it was kind of sad to use such high-quality beef in a hamburger, the Patty was delicious and worthy of medium rare or medium cooking just like a steak. The fries were delicious, sandwich five guys fries in a condiments on the hamburger perfect.For lunch, this place took less than 15 minutes to get my food on the table. If you're looking for a high-quality business lunch for reasonable price, this is your place in this is your hamburger"
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"For the first time we went to a fancy place and not judged based on our appearance. The moment we walked in we were treated with massive amount of respect my face was sore from smiling! The price is a little WOW but if you want to feel special it's worth the price in my opinion. They took my jacket, pulled out my chair, let me sample wines...etc just wow thank you! The steak I never had anything so amazing before!!! They cut it up for me after I joked about it and it just feel apart in my mouth and I just wanted to suck up all the flavor and lick the plate! We even had some fancy desert which wasn't my flavor but the presentation was just wow lol deff coming back the next time I want to feel like 100% oh la la"
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,4,"As known... Perry's is fine dining. They specialize in high-grade cuts of steak and massive pork chops!My folks took me and my sis here for dinner on Sunday. We were both new to Perry's and very excited (of course we'd heard the hype).I ordered the Prime Bone-In Cowboy Ribeye... same as the father parent. Mother parent had the salmon.  My sis went with the Sunday special...a porkchop with soup or salad and a dessert trio. The sides serve 2-3 people. We ordered the vegan cauliflower risotto, au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. I also had a martini trio... which features 3 small versions of their martinis....I was pleased with them all! (The selections vary monthly). The lobster bisque, white bean chili (seasonal) and the butcher's salad were also ordered and were loved! As far as my meal, I shockingly preferred the risotto best out of the selected sides. My steak wasn't cooked evenly but I did enjoy it still.  Father parent's steak was overcooked... he returned it and the manager soon presented him with a perfectly even cooked medium steak!My sis's porkchop was massive... I've never seen a cut of pork so large. Definitely worth the price! Seems that I have a more simplistic palette because I wasn't overly impressed with the taste of my own food (hence my 4 stars). Now the decor, service and ambience were IMPECCABLE! No details were left unnoticed! Truly superb...I think I'll try them for happy hour since the drinks were so great and since it'll be on my dime! Lol!"
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,4,"Excellent service, beautiful surroundings, and exquisite food.  Can I confess that every time I've been to Perry's I've ordered the exact same thing? I start with a Caesar salad - probably one of the best in the city.  It's very generously dressed with a garicky, citrusy, creamy Caesar dressing, with big crispy croutons and spicy pepitas.  Then, I move on to the Pork chop.  Everything you've heard about Perry's pork chop is true.  It's massive.  It comes to you on a sizzling ""fajita skillet"" such that the sweet, buttery, smoky deliciousness is oozing and sizzling all over the dish.  It's carved into ribs, loin, and juicy cap portions and served with a side of applesauce.  It's tender, smoky perfection, and absolutely too much food for even the largest of humans.  Eat generously from the family-sized portions of cheesy potatoes and grilled vegetables because you're going to take most of that pork chop home anyway.When it comes to desserts, Perry's knocks it out of the park here too.  The cheesecake is amazing and the chocolate-hazelnut crunch cake is delicious (you might as well be eating candy!), but the real standout is always the creme brulee for me.  It's my favorite dessert, and Perry's version does not disappoint."
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,4,"We went in on the last day of Perry's Four for $44 after 4:00. I chose the Fried Asparagus with crabmeat as an app, the Butcher's Chop Salad, the Ultimate Chicken Parm for entree, and the Dessert Trio. Overall the meal was decent and enough that I was able to have over half of my entree for lunch. On my next visit I will try the Filet or stick with the chops because the chicken parm is a one time deal for me. It didn't win me over. However, I do think this was a nice deal considering the regular menu price for each item.David and Torey (in training) were very attentive and made sure we had all that we needed to enjoy our meal. I was able to get a pic of my friend's app of Pork Chop Bites as she enjoyed her 1st time visit with the Bacon-Wrap Filet, Butcher's Chopped Salad, and Dessert Trio. I'll Be Back!!!"
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"Perry's absolutely lived up to the hype. We went for a family member's birthday, and were able to make reservations for 15 people on Open Table with no issues. The drink selection was absolutely superb. The Raspberry Crusta was the best drink, but I found the martini flight to be the best option in order to have a taste of multiple delicious drinks for the price of one.I had the Filet Perry, which was incredible. I tasted my brother's porkchop, and it quickly became clear why it's considered ""famous."" The porkchop is rather massive though, so I've already decided to get the Porkchop Bites appetizer as my meal next time I go. Service was impeccable, with wait staff going above and beyond! Obviously the prices are quite high, but it's perfect for a special occasion."
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"My second time at Perry's, and I must say that my wife and I were blown away by the hospitality. We were greeted by everyone as we walked to our table. Our waitress Haley did a phenomenal job of of taking care of us. Also, Ms. Suzanne Cisneros made sure we were having a a delightful evening. For starters we had the Perry's famous pork chop bites, excellent. For our entree we had the 14 oz ribeye and whipped mash potatoes, a little piece of heaven. And for dinner we had the white chocolate cheesecake, so delicious. From start to finish we had the meal perfect! Thank you Perry's for an awesome date night. We will be back!"
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"From start to finish we had such a great experience here! Felt like we were on vacation. The live musician was a fabulous touch to this romantic dinner. The 5 stars was for the experience. If I had to rate the food it would be more like 4/5 or 3.5/5. We had the pork chop bites which were very good. Then we had salads, wedge for my husband and pear for me. I enjoyed the pear but the dressing was a bit too vinegary for me. Then we had surf and turf pasta which was delicious and husband had the cowboy ribeye which to me was on the salty side and a little over cooked. The bread they bring you is also really good here! Way too full for dessert but we will be back to try that!"
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,1,"We first went as invited guests. My steak was soo cold the butter would not melt. I waived down waiter and showed him my cold steak . When he saw butter would not melt he laughed and walked off. So our second time we walked in telling waiter and hostess of horrible first meal . Well 2 and half hours later our meal arrived......I had asked for rare steak ...... fully cooked not a hint of pink......was served to me!Waiter and manager agree it is NOT rare , and ask if I want another ..... I said yes  but I don't want to wait another 2 1/2 hours! Well how about desert on us????Excuse me ???? We can pack a desert for you to take home....we are closing down........FYI it was not busy at all .Left and will NEVER go back"
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"Upscale restaurant with laid back atmosphere.  Food never disappoints.  Wait staff very attentive and informative.  Almost any wine you would want.  I am a beer drinker and wish they had more beer selections, but I do understand it is upscale and most diners prefer wine."
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"My husband and I attended a work dinner in one of the private rooms and it was delightful from beginning to end! We walked in to a clean and well laid out space. The servers were very attentive and made sure we always had a drink in our hand. The buffet set up was clean, the food was warm and it was all delicious! We will definitely be back to experience dining for just us."
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,I was very surprised and pleased with everything we ordered. Our waiter Chase made awesome recommendations. This will definitely be a regular stop by place whenever we are in Birmingham.
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,Good food. We had the pork chops and they were amazing. The side orders were sauté mushrooms and AU Gratin. It  was a good meal.
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"FANCY! A great and intimate place to dine. Word of warning. Make reservations. This is not a walk in place. The food no matter what you get, is sheer delicious. I got the surf and turf, which was lobster tail and steak pieces. It was great to the last bite. I would also warn you to save room for their desserts. They have a few selections that would sit well with any sweet tooth person. Place is dressy, no blue jeans or tee shirts permitted."
Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille - Birmingham,5,"Everything I've tried here has been amazing, and the service is above and beyond every time I go. I treat it as more of a special occasion restaurant, but they have a Sunday supper special plus great happy hours if you want to visit for a more affordable meal. I've tried the Filet Perry, Surf and Turf Pasta, Pork Chops, Lobster Bisque, French Onion Soup, and multiple deserts and sides, and I must say I've never ever been disappointed. I recommend the Brussels sprouts. Don't leave without trying those Brussels sprouts! The lobster Mac is decadent, you honestly could close your eyes and order and walk away with a fantastic meal."
Cajun Bistro Express,5,"I haven't gotten a chance to eat at many places with the Coronavirus pandemic going on. Pandemic or not, Cajun Bistro Express really delivered on great food last night. I ordered via Grubhub and was told my food would be ready between 6:20-6:30 PM. I let the restaurant know I was in the parking lot around 6:25 PM. They said they'd bring the food to my car. Around 6:40, a man came out and apologized for our wait. He brought drinks out as a way to make up for the tardiness. Around 6:45 PM, the food was delivered to my car.When I got home, I almost inhaled the food. It was that good! It's heavily seasoned, but it wasn't too much or salty. I heard myself smacking so I tried to chill out. Lol! Pandemic or not, I'll be back for that delicious food and considerate service!"
Cajun Bistro Express,5,"Hidden Gem!! Let me start off by saying the customer service is AWESOME!! Friendly, personable and down to earth. When we arrived there was not a wait (plenty of parking) so the owner was able to thoroughly go over the menu with us and let us sample the different sauce flavors as well as the different lemonade flavors. The majority of the menu is totally customizable. I ordered the shrimp and crab bistro fries, shrimp and crab quesadilla and shrimp and crab gumbo.While waiting, I sampled all the lemonades, along with other guest as they began to enter the restaurant. There are about 10 different flavors and all were really good. My favorites are mango, pineapple and peach. We also sampled the different flavor sauces that is used with the French fries, chicken, shrimp and other items. The food is made to order so expect a wait, unless you call in your order. The staff is so friendly that I didn't realize that I had a lengthy wait for our food. I honestly don't know how long I waited because I had such a good time conversing with the owner.Now on to the food. So I'll start with the gumbo. I was afraid to eat the gumbo because the owner is t from New Orleans. Y'all this was the best gumbo I've had, EVER. The gumbo sauce was thick and just bursting with flavor. An overflow of shrimp and crab. Just delicious!!The bistro fries were cooked to perfection, it was a sauce added to it and I am not a sauce person but it was delicious. The quesadilla was the . It was full of shrimp, crab, peppers and they added their special sauce on top and it was so yummy!!!If you live in Birmingham or if you're passing through you have to stop by. You won't be disappointed!!"
Cajun Bistro Express,3,Decided to try this place while I was in the area. I got the bistro fries with shrimp and crab. It was alright but a little expensive. The shrimp was fresh but the crab was imitation.
Cajun Bistro Express,1,"Gumbo was super salty and not seasoned well. Chicken salad was not fresh, lettuce is wilted, and there was no dressing included."
Cajun Bistro Express,4,"Yum yum yum ! I ordered the crab plate with traditional sauce, with a extra crab cluster with the swamp sauce. Ooooweeeee it was DIVINE. I also ordered the shrimp, crab, sausage gumbo/fries. Alll very delicious !! The fries come in a half- sized box - it was very flavor but needed more toppings and fries for $15-17 dollars. We also had the sour apple lemonade- OMG !! My boyfriend and i thoroughly enjoyed our food! - first time customers turned into lifetime customers !!"
Cajun Bistro Express,5,"Driving through town and saw this on Yelp. The place is small and out of the way, but definitely worth the stop. Bistro fries are awesome and plenty enough to share."
Cajun Bistro Express,5,"Super tasty hole in the wall. The fries with shrimp, crab, and sausage were delicious. Fair prices too."
Cajun Bistro Express,5,"I was so excited to try this place after my foodie friend recommended it.  Walking in i was greeted by the cashier immediately, she was very friendly and was able to answer all the questions we had. The wait was not long at all, the smell coming from my box would not allow me to wait until i got home. I tried my sisters shrimp and fell in love lol. Not only did the food look like the pictures but it was sooooooo good. We had the shrimp boil and the crab boil both were seasoned to perfection. The portion size was great not skimpy but also not overwhelming and the price point was great."
Cajun Bistro Express,1,Wait time for chicken wings and waffles was literally forty minutes and that was ridiculous. The began to get long and upon checking in on order I had to check on it three times. They aren't professional when it comes to setting expectation time for an order especially if you call in 15 minutes before.
Cajun Bistro Express,4,"I'm super excited this place opened in West End! It's located in the former soul food restaurant off of Pearson. Staff is always friendly, and they make ordering really easy via GrubHub. Food is a mix of seafood, Cajun staples, and some great fusion foods.The grilled shrimp salad is great for lunch, as is the Cajun fish and fries. The bistro fries are great as well, and the shrimp & grits were standard fare. Food is always fresh and well-seasoned.The storefront is clean, and overall, this is a welcome addition to the area! It's worth it for the price & quality of food.PS: check the hours before going, as there are occasions when they're not open."
Cajun Bistro Express,2,"This place is convenient, being 3 minutes from my house. Cost a bit much for the portions though and customer service isn't a strong point(especially over the phone). Granny's fish & grits is better IMO."
Cajun Bistro Express,5,"Cajun bistro is soooo good! The first time I tried the bistro quesadilla loaded with everything ! Let me start with the sauce. The sauce is magnificent you will want it on every single bite. I really can't describe what the sauce tastes like. It is something you just have to try. The flavors were there throughout the whole quesadilla. Def a must try. The shrimp and grits were good as well. I had the shrimp and grits loaded as well ( bacon, shrimp, crab, sausage and chicken) i will def be back for more."
Cajun Bistro Express,5,Was traveling out of town and in the mood for a good lunch option and stumbled upon this gem. All I can say is... the food was AMAZing!! Would definitely be worth checking out while you are in the area if you are looking for a quick bite to eat!
Cajun Bistro Express,5,Great customer service and overall experience. Black owned and operated. The food tastes amazing! They sell homemade lemonade that goes towards the owners kids college funds!
Cajun Bistro Express,5,"It was my first time visiting, and I had an amazing experience. The owner was very friendly and helpful I was so undecided, but I end up getting the shrimp and grits bowl with everything in it. It was sooo good the grits were just the right texture and everything. I will definitely be going back."
Cajun Bistro Express,5,Glad to see this place in West End. Nice option for the neighborhood. The shrimp and grits were great. I hope this place lasts and gets the support from its neighbors.
Cajun Bistro Express,5,"I am not sure where to start! I LOVE this place. The menu is awesome. We tried various dishes today including the Gumbo! Everything was AMAZING! The customer service was superb! The atmosphere was very relaxing! The music was on point! I'm telling you everything about this place was great. We were waiting on my son at the barbershop and my car at the car wash. I'll have to yelp them separately because they were exceptional as well! While waiting to get a spot at the car wash, the owner personally walked across the street to secure my spot. He greeted us by name and was even accommodating when we needed a spot to eat the fine cuisine once it was ready! Kudos to the strong beautiful BLACK MEN that have invested in the community and keeping the area safe, full, and well groomed!  The block is hot in the most POSITIVE manner. I can't wait to see what other businesses grow from what they have started. Lord knows the young men in the community need to see these Men handling business!! Urban League use to be on the corner and one their many purposes was to provide guidance to youth of the community to steer them away from trouble. They would be proud of these men. This business should definitely be supported in a major way!! EAT (everything), DRINK (swamp water), and be Merry!! It's all worth it!! May God bless this area and shine his favor on this business!! ROCK OUT Crimson and Cream!!!!"
Cajun Bistro Express,5,"EDIT.......Sooooo, I went back today /8/2/19) for my seafood boil. It was AWESOME!!!!!! Tasty and enough for leftovers for dinner. The key lime pie is good and moist too. 8/1/19 I went for something quick that I could eat on the go so I opted for the lunch portion of the catfish and fries with a Swamp juice. It was DELICIOUS and the LUNCH portion is right in line with the price point ($5). I am stuffed and satisfied. The catfish and fries were well seasoned and crispy. That squeezed fresh lemon and homemade tarter sauce just took it to another level. I am addicted to crab legs so I will return TONIGHT for dinner...... update to follow!!!!! (I didn't have time for a picture because I tore into it before I realized)"
Cajun Bistro Express,5,"calling all seafood lovers! if you want seafood on the go, Cajun Bistro Express is the place to go. here's what i loved about it. 1st...butter, butter, butter! butter makes everything better and Cajun Bistro Express does not hold back. clearly, by the photos, you see there's no lack in seasoning either! i had the crab legs and my niecey poo had the chicken and sausage quesadilla. the crab legs come with your choice of a dipping sauce; gator or swamp. you won't go wrong with either but i prefer the gator with the crab legs as the swamp has a light sweetness to it that i think would pair well with chicken (and yes they have wings too!!!) so here's what i liked about the quesadilla (of course i had to taste her food too ). i haven't had many quesadillas because they're always boring; cheese, meat, and flour tortillas (yawn). well Cajun Bistro Express  quesadillas are far from boring. the tortillas are seasoned and toasted (thank you!!!) and the filling was very flavorful! my niece thoroughly enjoyed it! so again, this location is for when you're on the go. but if you're looking for a seafood night of sitting and dining, they have a location for that in Center Point."
Cajun Bistro Express,5,I can't begin to tell you how delicious the food was.  They gave a huge portion. The crab legs wasn't small and the shrimp had the perfect texture. I had never eaten the boiled eggs until trying Cajun Bistro and after eating them I hate I waited so long. The sauce is AMAZINGGGG!!!
EATS Highland,5,"Lovely dinner night here! Just a heads up it's table service at night, we got confused for a second haha. Our waiter was very nice and every person who interacted with us was super friendly. We got our drinks fast and my soup came out promptly! The vegetable soup was better than I thought it would be! It contained a healthy amount of veggies and also made a nice cornbread dip. We shared the dishes and sides we got. Fried green tomatoes. A perfect side for 2 people, comes with 4. Mac and cheese, my usual go to, nice and creamy with cheese on top. Green beans, I thought these would be the cheap canned ones but they're actually fancily cooked ones that tasted amazing (see pics). I had the pulled pork main with conecuh sauce on top. My only criticism of it is that they could have pulled the pork just a little more to mix the sauce deeper into the meat. Overall, loved the food, loved the people, and I will definitely be back to try the fish cakes!!!"
EATS Highland,5,"I've been running by Eats on Highland for months waiting for it to open and finally had a chance to check it out.  First impressions were great.  They're about 5 weeks open as I write and when I stopped in I was the only customer, but multiple call-in orders were picked up while I ate.  I met chef/owner Wendy who gave me a rundown of the menu and showed me the daily special which looked fantastic.  I ended up ordering 2 pulled pork tacos which came with rice & beans.  Tacos were served in 2 corn tortillas each which I thought was great since it made them a little easier to eat and the food quality was superb.  The menu is kind of reminiscent of Rojo a couple parks away with Latin cuisine on one side and Southern cooking on the other. Wendy told me that they're waiting on their liquor license from the state, so a limited bar is coming soon.  Also, they're going to have outdoor seating in the near future which I think will be a real draw and great for the location.  The restaurant was clean and the decor pretty cool.  This spot on Highland Ave. really needed someone to renovate the nasty buildings, so Eats is a great addition to the neighborhood & I'll definitely be back to try some other menu options."
EATS Highland,5,"This place may very well be my new favorite lunch spot. I love how they tie in southern comfort food with a South American flare.I couldn't decide what to order, so the owner took the time to break down the menu for me. I decided on the fish cakes with mac n cheese and fried green tomatoes.. it was delicious. The fried green tomatoes were probably the best I've ever had, so those are a must when you check this place out. Come support this restaurant, Bham. You wont be disappointed!"
EATS Highland,5,"I went on a Saturday night when I was looking for something new. The service was exceptional. I asked how the soup of the day was and was promptly given a sample to try. I ordered the chicken breast with a side of macaroni and cheese and green beans. The chicken was seasoned perfectly (as were the green beans). To end a great meal, I ordered the brownie that came with vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce...absolute perfection."
EATS Highland,5,"I went there for the first time today. I ordered the seared tilapia with yellow rice and steamed broccoli as my two sides. The inside is quite pleasant. The husband, co-owner, greeted me and took my order. His wife, the other co-owner, was in the kitchen helping prepare food. He and the waitress on duty were welcoming and asked how I'd heard of the restaurant.My food was cooked to order, so it was freshly hot! They steamed my broccoli just right, but it was bland. I still ate it because I like veggies. One of the cooks asked if I wanted the lemon herb sauce on my fish or on the side; I opted for on the fish. Although the lemon herb sauce wasn't quite what I hoped for, it didn't take away from the meal as a whole. I also received 2 mini cornbread muffins which were delicious. I didn't have to wait long for my food, another plus.Overall, I would recommend Eats! I look forward to trying other dishes on the menu!"
EATS Highland,5,This is a wonderful addition to this area. I ordered the grilled chicken breast with green beans and red potatoes. Everything was perfectly seasoned and delicious! We were able to eat there in less than an hour for lunch and they have a decent amount of parking.
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,"I've eaten at my fair share of James Beard Award winning restaurants, but Highlands stood out for its total lack of pretension paired with impeccable service and beautifully prepared food. My husband and I booked a last-minute trip to Birmingham and were able to call to snag a reservation for a table in the bar, which was dark, cozy and - frankly - felt more intimate than the dining room. Our waiter was a consummate professional and Pardis Stitt offered true Southern hospitality, warmly greeting diners as if we were all her dear friends.The menu changes frequently, but rest assured that you really can't go wrong. While every dish was delicious, the one must from our meal was their ever-present baked grits. It's always on the menu for good reason: it is pure comfort on a plate with the salty ham and earthy, buttery mushrooms surrounding the fluffy-on-the-inside, crispy-on-the-outside grit cake. For a perfect rendition of a classic, the Bois d'Arc Farm salad was another winner - stilton, pears, and bacon, oh my! I thoroughly enjoyed my tile fish that followed while my spouse nearly licked his pork chop plate clean. We were comfortably full, but couldn't resist the classic coconut cake, which was a sweet finish to a memorable meal.Thank you for a warm Alabama welcome, Highlands."
Highlands Bar & Grill,4,"If there is a restaurant that is a Birmingham institution among the wealthier crowd, there is literally only one name that locals would bring up, and it is undoubtedly Highlands. Not that there aren't other nice restaurants, but this spot has proven itself over time and is ran by a chef that most Alabamians are quite proud of. Opened in 1982, Highland's is a place that put Birmingham on the map in a positive way at a time when the post industrial iron period was about to wind down and transform the city. Frank formalized his cooking techniques by working in kitchens of San Francisco and France, creating a medley of American Southern and French cuisine that is difficult to find elsewhere. It was not a time when it was common to see a chef from Alabama going to study cooking in Europe, thus the story was already an anomaly. Frank Stitt was trying to pioneer sustainable agriculture and farming well before anybody in Alabama knew what in the world that actually meant or for that matter, cared. One of the signature items is the baked grits that has been around since the restaurant opened. It's a tasty grits preparation and without a doubt, something to try. The pheasant was spectacular, fairly lean and with a crispy delicious skin, served with grits and green beans. Pastries here are created by Dolester Miles, who has been in the job for well over 30 years. The opera cake is absolutely spectacular, gentle and complexly layered. The basque cake is peachy and moist, with a crispy delicious exterior and Chantilly cream. Not only are these likely the best desserts to discover in Alabama, but may be some of the best to be found in America. The attentiveness got derail was clearly evident. As far as service, generally fine, but not particularly attentive. The waitress did not seem in much of a mood to welcome people to the establishment. Many items on the menu were running out by 8:30pm on a Saturday night. Nobody was particularly impressed with the flounder that got substituted for the grouper. And then there are other questions, why would you run out of grits? They know they are always filled to capacity and ingredients to make grits are not immediately perishable. Highland's has by this point in Birmingham's history become a classic. It's evident that most people here have been around for decades working at their jobs and serving the rich crowds of Mountain Brook. It's a place of great food and shows many combinations of ingredients that are nearly impossible to find elsewhere, let alone be executed this well."
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,I've been staying in the five points area for a few months now. I have enjoyed lots of great food in the area with more John Beard award winning chefs in a small city then I've ever experienced. Friendly employees and unique foods. Highlands bar and grill tops  my list so far. The appetizers are wonderful. Bar staff makes excellent drinks. Pros everywhere work here.
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,I'm not going to write anything that hasn't been written before.  This place is hands down one of the best spots in the country.  Pretty much anything you'll order is amazing.  The only piece of advice that one could get is save room for dessert.  You will not be disappointed.
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,"Yum! Excellent dining experience.The food was delicious, and the service was spectacular. The highlight was the mushrooms on the grits. I love mushrooms, and it makes me so happy when mushrooms are done right. These mushrooms were perfectly tender and flavorful, which balanced the light grits. Can't say enough good things about the grits--a must-try if you come.Another must-try is the coconut cake. I was so stuffed from the meal that I could only manage to eat half of the cake at dinner, and the other half made a great breakfast the next morning."
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,"There's a reason why there's a hype surrounding this place - while the food is pricier here, I love that the dining experience here is uniquely unpretentious and inviting. Case in point: I saw Frank Stitt pass by while we were waiting at the bar, and he smiled and said hello. Service/Atmosphere: Most recently, I took my family here and they absolutely loved the dining experience. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable - don't be afraid to ask your server for recommendations here. Food/Drink: We tried a seafood salad and the stoneground baked grits as appetizers. For entrees we had the red snapper, salmon, and steak. It's hard to recommend a particular dish since they change the menu daily, but we thought both meat and fish options were great. Of particular note was a seafood salad we ordered which was colorful, bright, and absolutely delectable. By dessert, we were pretty stuffed, but we shared the apple fritters with ice cream and Ms. Dol Miles' famous coconut cake! Everything was delicious. I definitely hope to be back soon. Tips: - Definitely order a bottle for the table. In most cases, it's actually a better deal if at least 2 people are going to be having a glass :) - Make reservations about a month in advance! - If you can't snag a res, try finding a seat at the bar. It's quite cozy, and would be great if you're a small party. - They actually have great nonalcoholic beverage options if someone in your party is under 21 or doesn't drink. I had a lemonade that was delicious - it really tasted just like a cocktail without the alcohol."
Highlands Bar & Grill,3,"I'm in town only for Wednesday night, so I called and was 1) put on the waitlist and 2) told that sitting at the bar would be just as good as eating in the restaurant. We ended up with option #2 and had our dinner there!So, my party of 3 arrived at 5pm and claimed one of the 3 table tops at the bar. I had the venison ($36) and my friends had the steak ($30) and red snapper ($33). We shared the grits ($16) as a starter because we were told that it is a must because it is the ONLY thing on the menu that's long-standing. When our food arrived, we were each disappointed by our meals. In general, the temperature of all of our dishes were all lukewarm. The grit cake was cool and had no flavor. The sauce was good, but other than that, the grit cake was COMPLETELY bland.The venison, the steak, and the baked potato accompanying the the steak were also cold. They had clearly been sitting out for awhile. Both cuts of meat also lacked seasoning. Not even a sprinkle of salt! The only piece of food that was warm was the snapper, but my friend complained that it also lacked seasoning.All in all, we were super disappointed by ""the #1 restaurant in the country."" It didn't really come close, and it was incredibly expensive for what you can get in the area."
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,"I've lived in Birmingham my whole life and haven't had the chance to experience Highlands, until now! I was finally able to score reservations, which were for a month out. The whole experience was amazing. We walked in, gave our name, and were seated right away by the window. The ambience of the place is very romantic and elegant. Our waiter came out right away with water and to get appetizer and drink orders. I ordered the Highlands Martini. The drink was very strong and they give you the shaker with the remaining drink (makes about 2 martinis). They also give you complementary bread/muffins which were so fresh. I ordered the duck breast with greens and grits. The duck was cooked to perfection and was so delicious. I wasn't going to order a dessert, but they had a special of coconut cake, which I had been eyeing for a while, so I had to try it. The cake was fresh and the cream on bottom was amazing. The waiter was very personable and was prompt with everything. I am so glad I was finally able to try Highlands. I will definitely be back once their spring menu comes out!"
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,On arrival at The Highlands Bar And Grill in Birmingham Alabama we discovered that it was voted the best restaurant in America by the James Beard awards in 2018. I don't know how you can determine that but it was the best overall food and dining experience that we have had in several years anywhere in the world. I have never had oysters this good anywhere. The pork is another level and the desert was beyond description. I highly recommend this incredible restaurant. Our waiter was as good as it gets and we can't wait to return.
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,I made a reservation here weeks in advance because I heard great things about it and it was voted the best restaurant in the country so I wanted to see what all the bus was about. Frank stits definitely knows how to cook.FoodHere is what we got:Fried green tomatoesSquash soupLamb chopsRed snapperPeach crispCappuccinoEverything was cooked very well. It was a very tasty meal. I think we both enjoyed it a lot.ServiceAll of the wait staff were very attentive and excellent.Parkingthere is street parking and it's free. They also have valet which is a fee.Pricea bit on the high side but given the quantity and quality of food I won't complain about it too much.AmbianceThe place was very clean had very nice decor and the bathrooms were clean. Seating arrangement was fine tables are a little bit too close together.overall excellent meal I can see why it was voted the best restaurant in the country. I can't say enough great things about it if I was here again I would come back all the time!
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,"SIMPLY OUTSTANDING ! Not long back I was enjoying a delicious latte at a classy coffee shop on our last full day in Birmingham, AL. I was whinging to the coffee shop owner about bad coffees & meal choices since my wife and I flew in from California late the previous day. The sweet lady said we needed a great dining experience before we left Birmingham and suggested a restaurant called Highlands Bar & Grill.....a high end French restaurant a few miles from our Hyatt Regency hotel. It was so popular she challenged me to get a reservation for that evening. I looked the place up and it's high praise reviews plus 4.8 star rating were off the charts and diners had to reserve a table up to a month in advance. On top of that they served Venison, Quail and a bunch of other stuff I wasn't real familiar with. I texted my wife that this French place might be a great way to experience some Birmingham fine dining. When my wife finished training her staff at 5pm at her company's premises in Vestavia Hills..( the reason for our trip here ) I jumped in our rental car to go pick her up so we could arrive at the Highlands Bar & Grill soon after it commenced serving dinner at 5.30pm. I figured an early arrival might boost our chances of getting a table at no notice. The place was already pretty busy when we strolled through the front entrance to be greeted by Matt who was one of the managers ( the bar opened at 4pm ). I have posted 1000's of reviews & photos of restaurants, cafes, fine coffee shops + other stuff on the top review forums including Yelp & TripAdvisor for many years. I held up my iPhone with my Google Maps review profile showing 230 million photo views world wide. Matt the manager said they were booked out but he had a half table for us in the bar area...voila ! Hey it might have been my cute Aussie accent that scored us a table ! Inside there was a huge jazzy looking central bar dividing 2 large dining areas. We chose a Crab / Shrimp Louie Salad appetizer followed by a Venison, Quail, Pork Spare Rib Mixed Grill for mains and then a Chocolate Mousse Cake + decaf cappuccinos for dessert. We shared all of our courses.....this place wasn't cheap ! I knocked down a couple of Birmingham's own Good People Brewing IPA's as well during dinner. We were waited on by up to 5 different servers including our superstar Tina despite the restaurant being packed to the rafters. Smartly dressed Joseph who was also one of the restaurant managers came to our table to have a chat & suggest fine dining options at places like Canoe in Buckhead for when we arrive in Atlanta, GA the next day. Our meals tasted extraordinary and the plated presentation plus service attention exceeded almost anywhere we have dined. And big kudos to young Margaret for keeping us well hydrated all evening. Beautiful art nouveau framed posters adorned the high walls and the historic appeal of the interior/ exterior of the building added to our enjoyment. When we left to retrieve our rental car in the complimentary valet car park I said to my wife that the Highlands Grill & Bar is probably the best restaurant in Birmingham if not all of Alabama. Our valet attendant overhead me and said that the restaurant had just won the James Beard Award for ""Most Outstanding Restaurant In the USA"" after being in the finals 10 times. Apparently that is the same as winning an Oscar at the Academy Awards. Needless to say we were very impressed !"
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,"Absolutely EXCELLENT! We were lucky to grab the last 2 seats at the bar, which gave us a great view of the bar & restaurant. Our bartender Chris was fantastic! We just got engage and when Chris found out he immediately brought us 2 glasses of champagne and was genuinely happy for us! Definitely some of the best service we've received. 100% knowledgeable on the wine and food. Chris was attentive, friendly and patient as I had several questions on wine and food. Chris offered to have us sample a few of the wines before making a selection. Chris also provided thoughtful & honest critiques on several dishes as we seeked guidance on our starters & main dishes. There was a fabulous vibe throughout the bar & restaurant with the music adding to the mood. Overall we came with high expectations and we were not disappointed! From the valet staff, maitre d, and bar staff, everyone was on point! I was cautioned that Highland might come off a bit ""stuffy"" but we didn't have that impression at all. We will definitely be back the next time we're in town."
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,"What a great dining experience! I learned about Highlands Bar & Grill through a friend so said it was voted one of the best restaurants in America so of course I needed to see for myself. Fair warning, reservations for this place need to be made well in advance. We did not have a reservation but we arrived late enough that we figured we could just eat in the bar area and we were right. We only had to wait about 5 minutes before a spot opened up for us. Even at 9pm the place was still full.We sat down and ended up orderly a bottle of wine (the list was massive!) but they also had great looking cocktails I would want to try if we went back. We ended up ordering the Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio and the Stone Ground Baked Grits as starters. We really wanted the Crawfish Pie but that apparently sells out way early in the evening. Even though we didn't get the Crawfish Pie, both of our starters were amazing. The tuna was super fresh and had a great play on flavors and oh my gosh the Grits! I am not one to typically order grits but I am so happy we did! It was probably my favorite thing we had all night and I could've had multiple orders. It wasn't heavy like you would think grits would be and they were so flavorful!For the main course we split the Duck Breast. This was also delicious and they were nice enough to split it for us and it still had the great presentation you would expect if you got it for yourself. The service even at the bar was incredible! Our one bartender who we never got his name unfortunately was great! He was super attentive and helped us with everything on the menu. My favorite moment was when we were deciding what we wanted for dessert, he told us to get the Profiteroles because the chocolate sauce is homemade and people rave about it so much that they try to take a bowl full home with them. He also said the sweet and salty cake was great but what really made it was the caramel sauce so when he brought out the profiteroles, he brought us caramel sauce as well. He also made an awesome espresso martini for me to end the night. Next time I am back, I will for sure want to dine in the main dining area but the bar was a great way to experience one of the best restaurants in the country!"
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,What is there left to say other than Mr Stitt you are the master of fine food. We went here for our anniversary on August 16th and of course it was great. We didn't have reservations but found 2 seats at the bar. Just in case you didn't know..... the bar staff is as great and knowledgeable about the food as the rest of the staff. We started with the stuffed onions which were divine then my hubby ordered the flat iron steak and I got the halibut. What can I say other than incredible! I hope one day I can train with Frank and his staff.... it is my dream to be half as good.
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,Absolutely amazing from start to finish. We enjoyed a delicious bottle of Cade! It went perfectly we all our food choices. Oysters and crab claws....delicious to say the least. They we shared the rib eye. Wonderful. Looking forward to our next visit when we return to Birmingham!
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,"Pork CoppaNo wonder this place is jammed up on a weeknight.   Staff is very attentive and accommodating.   Had to take meal at the bar, and glad I did!  Pork Coppa medallions were cooked to perfection, topped with salsa verde and paired with a great medley of eggplant, peppers, tomatoes and onions, over a bed of grits.  Hope to be back, but will definitely make reservations in advance!  Can't imagine the wait list on weekends."
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,"Bang for your buck: 9/10Quality: 10/10Service: 10/10Ambiance/Location: 10/10Overall: 10/10When I travel, I require one fancy pants meal on the trip. For our trip to Birmingham, Highlands more than satisfied that requirement. It was almost like fate that I showed up at Highlands. I'd just heard about their collab with Hattie B's on the Potluck podcast and had read about their famous grits dish in the book Grits by Erin Byers Murray. With those two nods to the establishment, I knew I had to make myself a reservation. After a full day eating in BHam, Dave and I had saved just enough room for Highlands. We started our meal with the best oysters I'd ever had. Not only were the oysters fresh and flavorful, the accoutrements with which they were served were also very obviously high quality. We also enjoyed the Gulf shrimp cocktail. I just love Gulf shrimp, but these were exceptional! Plump and juicy, they were served with the tangiest cocktail sauce that didn't hide the flavor of the shrimp, but rather truly enhanced it. We made our way to the stone ground baked grits dish, and it was to die for. Absolutely creamy, it just melted in our mouths. I'm a huge grit snob, but I can say these really hit the mark! As we were full, we didn't want to push ourselves, but knew we had to get the coconut cake. If it was good enough for the James Beard Foundation, we knew we couldn't leave without it.  Now, I'm not a coconut person, but this cake was sinfully yummy. I think that's how ya know it's good food done right. And of course the service and the ambiance were top notch. We were treated so well from start to finish. And the restaurant feels historic and romantic. I'm surprised Highlands doesn't have higher reviews. I absolutely recommend it and can not wait to go back!"
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,"No reservation?No worries!If you don't mind eating perhaps a little earlier than is typical you can readily feed yourself at the Most Outstanding Restaurant in America for 2018 (according to the James Beard Foundation).The dining room opens at 5:30 & you might be lucky to book a table a month in advance of your intended meal (so long as you're not looking for a really prime seating time or large party)ORSimply show up at the Highlands excellent & spacious bar at about 4:30, claim some of the certain to be empty chairs (28 at the bar if memory serves), enjoy a well-made cocktail or glass of fine wine, & be the first to sample the evening's fare when the kitchen opens for bar meals at 5:00.The food was everything you'd expect from the best in the country, but perhaps even better, was the minimal 'damage' it did to my wallet!A couple of cocktails, 2 appetizers, main, dessert & an appreciatively generous tip came in at least 20% less than I'd expected to pay.I don't often get to Birmingham, but when I do, you can be sure I'll get to town early enough to grab a seat at the Highlands bar."
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,"(4.5 stars) I was very nervous I wouldn't be able to try this place on my weekend visit to Birmingham. I'm doing my typical foodie research a week before I go somewhere and I discover the best restaurant in the country is now in Birmingham. Reservations are of course booked solid, but thankfully, we were able to get a table pretty on a Friday night. Of course there can be a long wait for something at the bar -- where there is food service -- but we came around 9:30 or so and had no trouble sitting right down. I don't know if I would call it the best restaurant around but it's certainly a treat, and given its acclaim, it's really not too expensive of a splurge. The grits are an absolute must to start. A beautiful gritty texture with a wonderful base and mushrooms and prosciutto swimming around to richen it up. This stuff is lick-your-plate-clean kind of good.  The mains are wonderful too. We shared this lamb shank in this beautiful stew as well as a grilled fish dish. The fish was less memorable -- hard to make a fish really stand out -- but the lamb was diverse and uniquely comprised. Definitely a spot where pretty much no fish will disappoint. My only slight disappointment was the dessert. We went with the coconut cake which was super tasty but presented as just an average slice of cake. From the best restaurant in the country which was highlighted for its desserts, I was hoping for something a little more elegant or intricate."
Highlands Bar & Grill,5,Perfect place for a business dinner! Met with a client last night. A group of three. We were seated at a table in the bar. The place is very attractive. Service was excellent. Lamb chops with root veggies were great. Bar service was very good as well. I would like to try more of the menu!  I will be back.
Half Shell Oyster House,5,These are some really good oysters nice and meaty and tasty and clean like they just came out of the bay
Half Shell Oyster House,5,"New restaurant.  So far it is great. We had a dozen raw oysters from Louisiana.  They were meaty and delicious.  Hubby had seafood pot pie with NBC a cup of gumbo, and I had grilled snapper with a garden salad.  They make all their dressings and sauces which is a plus for me.  Lots of menu choices so we will be back."
Post Office Pies,5,"They have a very convenient curbside pick up area and the pizza was wonderful! It is recommended you order online through their website, where they give you an estimated pickup time. All you do when you get there is step up to the front door, they'll have your prepaid order, they hand you a sanitized pen, and you sign your bill at the door."
Post Office Pies,5,"Ummm how have I not reviewed post office pies?? Let me say, I don't usually love pizza. It's fine. It's ok. It's whatever. I LOVE post office pies pizza. Their wood fire pizza is so perfectly done. The right amount of melting cheese, charred and crispy crust, no soggy bottoms, it's perfect! Their pepperoni chunk bread is wayyy better than pepperoni pizza. The bread has chucks of pepperoni goodness while the pepperoni pizza is just the regular thin slices. Pass. My two favorite pizzas are the white pizza and the chicken pesto. Highly recommend. Their best thing on the whole menu though is their winter kale salad. Sadly it is spring so it's off the menu, but their Caesar salad is a good back up. Love that this place made the switch to full service sit down to order style! It's much better now. They also have a solid to go option- especially if you're at their neighbor, Avondale Brewery."
Post Office Pies,5,"This place was referred to me by friends in Florida that went to Culinary School with the owner and I almost drove to Florida to personally thank him for the recommendation. THANKS JOSHUA!!!I'm not a huge pizza fan but when I do eat pizza I want it to be good pizza and this fit the bill. It was fresh, hot out the oven delicious pizza. There was plenty of meat, the sauce was good and the cheese  was good and ""melty"".The atmosphere of the place was very laid back and the place was packed as it was a busy Friday night. Service was good and next year when we are back in town we will definitely come again."
Post Office Pies,5,Came for the CMP store about an hour east of here. Swung by on my way back to MS for a pit stop with my buddy as with both had a craving for some good NY style Pizza.Was not disappointed. Best pizza I've had in a long time. Perfect blend of cheese and just the right amount of sauce. Highly recommended. I would eat inside though so the bums don't bother you
Post Office Pies,4,"I'd bookmarked Post Office Pies after reading about it in ""Garden and Gun"" several years ago. When we were overnighting in Birmingham, it seemed the perfect time to stop in and try it out. The food was good, but I don't think I'd call it the best pizza I've ever had. It was the best pizza I'd had in Birmingham, for sure. Toppings were fresh, the crust was tender-chewy rather than cracker-like. Pizza is largely about preference in style, so I'd say this was a very good example and well-executed version of this style of pizza. I personally like wood-fired, cracker-crust style. The beers on tap represented a good selection with plenty of local options to choose from. Pizza takes about 30 min so be prepared to sit, enjoy the scene and have a leisurely meal."
Post Office Pies,4,"Not sure how I missed reviewing this place, but nice simple pizza spot in Avondale with a simple menu. No slices sold here only whole pies which they have a 9"" and a 12"" pie. I went with the basic pepperoni pie. Wood fire grill thin crust and basil. The pie is pretty good. . Staff is friendly and kids love it. From my understanding they use locally sourced ingredients here as well.  Pretty good pizza and other items on the menu also. Definitely worth trying out. Spacious enough for groups and they have TVs for games too."
Post Office Pies,5,Best pizza ever!! Been going here for 6+ years and never been disappointed! The jalapeño cheese bread is amazing! Great cocktails and great food!
Post Office Pies,5,"We really enjoyed this place. We had a party of 14 and once waitress had everyone waters and drinks incredibly fast. Pizza all came out at the same time hot (that was super impressive), and everyone was checked in on constantly. Great place for great pizza. Glad we chose this place"
Post Office Pies,5,"This was my first time eating at Post Office Pies and it was delicious! I went with some coworkers and we all enjoyed our meals. I had the Swine Pizza, which was cooked to perfection. The service was excellent and the vibe was just right for lunch. I would definitely go there again!"
Post Office Pies,5,"Another town, another conference, another chance to try some good local food.  This time it's Post Office Pies.  In a word, YUM.  Whether it's a simple cheese, or something with toppings, every bite is a delight.We took our pies next door to the Avondale Brewing beer garden.  The pies pair well with all the brews.  Go!"
Post Office Pies,5,"Love this place! The atmosphere is very inviting. I used to come here frequently prior to them seating you before you order, and I must say, being seated prior to ordering gives it a more personal feel. I normally get the Chicken Pesto pizza, which is my favorite, but decided to venture out and try the Italian pizza. I believe I found a new favorite! They do not short you on serving size either. I ordered the 9"" pizza for lunch and had over a half of pizza left. The sauce is light with just the perfect amount of cheese. Their sausage is prepared in house and is awesome! I definitely recommend this place and any pizza you get."
Post Office Pies,2,"I'm going to front load this review by saying that I visited here for dinner on Christmas Day so maybe it was an off day (for obvious reasons). The service was super slow and the staff was incredibly rude. It took over an hour to get a pizza. We got the cheesy bread to start, since they were out of the specialty salad, and I don't even understand why they sell this. It's just a pizza without sauce. It was tasty - sure - but no different from just getting a pizza. The main course was a large ""The Italian"" pie and it was...fine. There wasn't a lot of sauce, not a great amount of cheese and the sausage had no real depth of flavor. I don't know if I'd ever order this pizza again. The drinks were also disappointing. While they claim to have a good selection of beers most of them weren't ones I'd want to drink with pizza (too dark). The two I did get were poured with so little care they were 25% foam, which is disappointing when you're paying over $7 a glass. I think maybe I wouldn't care as much until I learned the owner used to work at Per Se. There's no reason someone who has worked at a good restaurant would run a place this sloppily. Idk if I got a bad experience because of the date (in which case this place shouldn't be open on Christmas) or it's like this all the time (in which case it should be managed better). Either way it reflects poorly on the owner and I can't think of a reason to give this place another try."
Post Office Pies,4,Pizza here is pretty good. I like the Caesar salad - the size is good. Chicken pesto and chicken parmesan pizzas are the ones we've tried.
Post Office Pies,3,"I ordered the white pizza to-go. This place was very cute on the inside when I walked in to pay! Unfortunately, the cheese and toppings were just average but the crust of the pizza was great!"
Post Office Pies,5,"Such good pizza. We got a ton of food and all was amazing - very juicy meatballs, spicy, great pizza bread to start and then two pizzas - I got the margherita and my husband made his own with meat sauce. We ate it all!!!!"
Post Office Pies,5,"Stopped by to take a pie to someone that had surgery and on bed rest.   I talked with a few customers that were outside as I waited for the pizza to cook.  They informed me about a secret menu I look forward to trying one weekend soon.  I hadn't tried Post Office Pies before until I was invited to a private event there a few weeks ago.  I love their sauce more than anything else.  Chain pizza had spoiled pizza for me because of their canned sauces.  Everything here is made fresh and I can taste the difference.   The dining room isn't the quietest but it's a lively type of restaurant.  The clientele is a mixture of college students, families, couples on dates, regulars and take out people like me.  I will go back soon and meet friends there too.   My friend enjoyed their pie and said it was still hot when they opened the box."
Post Office Pies,4,"Over all a great meal at Post Office Pies. We were seated very quickly. Even for 7:30pm on a Friday night. Parking can be a bit difficult to find sometimes in this area. The menu was very good and very inclusive of all Diets. My wife is a vegan and she had no problem finding something she could eat. Even if someone in your party does not enjoy pizza, they have a couple other options. I had the Meatball sandwich. It was a quality sandwich. The meat balls had great flavor, and the bread was fantastic.We started with the cheesy bread app. It was just the right size for 4 people to split. The pizzas come in 9"" and 12"". However, all of the pizzas that we ordered were all bigger than we ordered. Example, the 9"" was actually 12"" and the 12"" we had was actually 15""It is a pretty loud space. The night we were there, a family let there kids run ALL over the restaurant and even run up to peoples tables and harass them. It took about 10 minutes for the staff to handle it. Personally, if I had not been meeting people there, I would have walked out if the staff had not handled instantly. They did have a nice beer selection. I for once didn't actually take a look at the liquor selection. They did however have a few signature cocktails."
Post Office Pies,1,"I'm going to make this very short. I ordered meatballs . They told me after I paid that they were out of them. I then ordered cheese sticks. It took about 45 minutes for a order of cheese sticks. When I bit into my first piece , I bit into some hard plastic. (Picture below) I will not be going back!"
Post Office Pies,4,"I came here with the yelp elite squad to try some of their non-pizza items! First they brought us out a huge ceasar salad on a pizza pan. It was very good. I loved their dressing and cheese. Their dressing definitely tasted homemade. Creamy and delicious! Next, they brought us out baked ziti and cheese bread. Their baked ziti was definitely tasty, but it was lacking sauce. Their cheese bread was exquisite. Perfectly cooked and their marinara was super flavorful. Lastly they brought us out lasagna. The Lasanga noodles were tender and the sauce was very amazing. It needed more sauce and more cheese. The most impressive part of the event had to be their cocktails. Every single one I tried was very unique and refreshing. I had the Peach Lemonade and the mango Lemonade. Both the Peach and Mango were excellent. Overall, I had a fantastic experience at Post Office Pies, and I will be back."
Post Office Pies,5,Excellent pizza and garlic cheese bread. It was a bit too loud so we sat outside. People watching was entertaining . They were SUPER friendly & accommodating towards our service dogs (in training).
150 & Main,5,"We were in Michigan because of family emergency for several weeks and due to the COVID 19Virus it was not possible to go to a restaurant. We called 150 & Main and ordered curbside serviceand were very pleased with their choices and loved the fresh cooked items on the menu.We tried a lot of the items and were very satisfied with the service, the food and the pricing.Our favorite was Spicy Cajun Chicken with Fettuccine! Great Food! PL ,Alabama"
150 & Main,2,"The only reason I'm giving this review two stars is because of the manager. He was very nice and friendly. He stopped by to check on us before food came he seemed very pleasant. I went with a group of my friends to have lunch. By the time I got there they said four different waiters/waitresses have came to the table. So they didn't know who was who. When I arrived a fifth person who is totally different from the ones they saw came over and asked what I want to drink. Low and behold he was the bartender. I asked for water and water for my daughter. My water came but hers never did. We had questions about the menu and asked the waitress her opinion. Pretty much everything we asked she said was good so we were kind of excited about trying this restaurant. We had to ask for bread to be brought to the table so the kids could nibble on it. For the kids we ordered chicken and waffles, but instead of chicken wings we asked for waffles. For the table a grouper sandwich was ordered, a wedge salad, the crabcake Napoleon, a cup of seafood gumbo, I had the surf and turf and instead of the catfish I asked to substitute for salmon and a cup of gumbo. While we were sitting and talking another couple and their child came and sit one table away from us surprisingly they got their appetizer and food before ours and we wondered why that was.Skipping to the food, it was brought out on a tray (by someone totally different again) and it just sat there. I looked at my friends and I asked, do we need to serve ourselves?? We waited several minutes and then finally our waitress came out and her response was ""why did he not give the food out?"" We sat there looking super puzzled. As you can tell from the picture, of my food looked disgusting but looks can be deceiving so I thought... I took one bite out of my meal and the salt was overwhelming. I thought maybe it was just me so I asked my best friends to try it and they thought the same. So while I waited for the waitress to return I decided to try my gumbo which was cold. Also they forgot the syrup for the kids chicken and waffles and instead of chicken tenders they brought whole wings. The waitress came back and we informed her of what was going on at our table. She said she will bring out hot gumbo and gave me the menu to see if I wanted to place an order for anything else. She brought out the gumbo and the manager came by to speak with us. I informed him that my meal was way overly salted and I didn't want to order anything else. He insisted that I try something else I hesitated, but I went with the fried catfish. The chicken on the kids meal had no seasoning it was just OK. My daughter ended up dipping it in ketchup and they didn't use the syrup at all. As far as the crabcake Napoleon, my friend said that it was OK but the sauce that they used to put on top of it was salty as well. From what she ordered she said the best thing was the wedge salad. My other friend had no complaints about the fried grouper sandwich. My catfish that I decide to get was hot and good. Maybe this restaurant does well with fried foods...who knows. I have to be truly honest our waitress seemed aggravated about my discontent with my meal. The customer service needs a little tweaking. I enjoy waiters and waitresses come in to check on me during my meal, but it was too many different ones that we couldn't keep up. The only reason we know one of there names is because it was on the ticket. We went mid day and it was very very empty for it to be right in the heart of Patton Creek across the street from the Galleria. I really wanted to like this place and it was on my list of restaurants to try but I can honestly say I won't be going back."
150 & Main,3,"I went in for brunch today, which is served on Saturdays and Sundays from open until 3 PM. I sat in the bar area which is nice and fairly spacious. They have a somewhat limited brunch menu (6 options) however there's something for every pallet. There's also the full lunch menu to choose from at that time also. I ordered the salmon Rainer which is served with potatoes and two salmon Benedict with spinach and a really nice sauce. The food was legit good - absolutely no complaints there. I will definitely go back to try the chicken and waffles.The service was not great but it was horrible. The bartender was my server. He seemed quite stressed out but for no apparent reason. I asked him for an alcoholic drink recommendation (as he is the bartender..). In response he told me to look at the menu and pick something and explained that he was really busy. I got the feeling that he was either new or rude, so I ordered unsweetened tea and  kept it moving."
150 & Main,3,"This restaurant is right near the movie theater in the Patton Creek shopping center. Would be great for dinner and a movie. Parking lot directly outside the restaurant gets full but don't be deceived, because the restaurant is huge. Plenty of seating. The interior is a large open space with a big fireplace. Plenty of booths. We have been here twice for dinner. First time I had the New Orleans pasta. It was fantastic! Loved it. Hubby got the pasta alfredo with shrimp and he loved his too. The kid got a burger and she really liked hers. Second time we decided to get steak. I got the prime rib, hubby got the ribeye. My prime rib was cooked perfectly and was very tender. However, it was VERY salty. I ate part of it but could not eat any more due to all the salt. Very disappointing especially because it is so expensive. Unbelievably, hubby's ribeye was exactly the same. I think it was the au jus over the top, just way too salty. Two perfectly good steaks ruined. Hubby let me try his mac n cheese. Tasted good but way too salty as well! This did not get eaten. I had baked potato and broccoli. Baked potato was good but broccoli was undercooked so did not eat it.  So our 2nd experience not that great. Very expensive and most of the food wasn't edible.Service was good both times. But we were never asked if our meal was okay the second time or I would have told our server about the salt issue. We will be back but will steer away from the steaks."
150 & Main,4,"Came here for a birthday lunch on MLK day. We were seated promptly and by the fireplace which was so nice and cozy! The interior is like chic winter cabin vibes - open and airy with high ceilings. The menu has plenty of seafood items, which is what everyone at the table ordered except me.For apps we got fried and boiled crab claws, the fried ones were the better ones! And the shrimp dip was delicious! Creamy and flavorful with fried pitas chips. I ordered the veggie plate because the sides looked so delicious! I got a baked potato, sauteed zucchini & squash and mac n cheese and sub'd 3 hushpuppies for fries. The veggies were well seasoned and cooked perfectly! Def surprised by that because normally it's a bland side no one orders! Mac n cheese was really good too! Bubs got the crab cakes, which came with 2 sides (baked sweet potato and zucchini & squash) and he was really pleased with the chunky crab meat. Overall great meal and visit!"
150 & Main,5,"Just came for the first time and we all agreed we will be back!  Our waitress Tonya Lee was very personable and took great care of us.  Two of us are obsessed with the  Crab Cake Napoleon (definitely will crave it... I'm usually very picky about crab cakes and fried green tomatoes but both were OUTSTANDING) and two of us really liked Alfredo.  We also had hush puppies (good), pimento cheese balls (good- I would have liked them to be consistent sizes), and bread pudding (not bad- good texture but not super flavorful)."
150 & Main,2,"From the other reviews I see since the recent opening of 150 & main, I must have been at a different restaurant or they lost their opening mojo.We went in last night and they were not busy at all. Just a few tables with people. The specials listed at the entrance stated the soup of the day was shrimp bisque.When we sat down we were greeted by 2 friendly servers ( one in training) so that really had me thinking we would get great service.Fast forward to ordering. I asked for the bisque and a salad and unfortunately that soup was not available. Strike one. I went with a spinach salad and my hubby ordered the open face prime rib sandwich with shaved Brussels sprouts and my daughter has Mac and cheese. While waiting we ordered hush puppies. The hush puppies were cooked well but nothing special and no spice. We had to wave down the 2 servers for drink refills. Strike 2.We then got our food. The open face prime rib was on non toasted plain white bread and it was dry. My husband said like ""chipped beef on toast"" with no toast and no sauce. But edible I guess. The shaved Brussels sprouts were so salty he could not eat them so we sent them back. Strike 3. My daughters mac and cheese was dry and her broccoli was most likely from a steamed frozen bag.The only thing I can say was good was the honey celery seed dressing for my spinach salad and that my salad was fresh ....but nothing to write about.There have been 2 restaurants in this location in the past 8 years and none have survived. Unfortunately, I am not sure this one will make it unless the get better servers and better food."
150 & Main,3,"I'm torn with this review.  Some things were great and others mediocre.  I hope that someone who owns or manages this restaurant will see this review.  This is a great location for a restaurant, but there are a few areas of improvements needed.  Wait staff were very friendly and helpful.  I got the Country Fried Sirloin with mashed potatoes and a premium side of shaved Brussels Sprouts with Bacon.  My husband ordered from the new Brunch Menu.  He got Salmon Rainer which was essentially Eggs Benedict with Salmon. They offered and we got two rolls while we were waiting for our food.  They were delicious, but come on people serve real butter not margarine.  The Sirloin was delicious and well cooked.  Just two things.  Don't put country fried foods on top of mashed potatoes and put the saw meal gravy on the side.  The center was so mushy.  The Sprouts were good.  I expected more with paying a premium price, but I did need to mix them up because a couple of spots were very salty.  The potatoes and gravy were delicious. I also asked for a biscuit which was really good.  My husband loved the Salmon Rainer which is only available on Sundays during brunch.  Large pieces of salmon.  Eggs cooked perfectly.  Really nice sauce.  We ordered peach cobbler a la mode for dessert.  It was delicious.  Tasted homemade with vanilla bean ice cream.  Enough for two to share.  In summary, food was delicious.  Service good, but a little slow.  Very friendly staff."
150 & Main,5,"We were invited to a soft opening last night at 150 and Main in Hoover. It was delightful and delicious! We started with a Chile Shrimp appetizer and a tuna dip appetizer. Both were really good. The Shrimp were placed on top of a spicy slaw mixture. The tuna dip came with tomatoes and jalapeños and some delicious pita triangles. We ordered a Cajun Surf and Turf that was a fresh Catfish on top of dirty rice with a crawfish etouffe Over the top. Perfectly cooked and wonderfully seasoned. Another entree was a pasta combination with chicken and shrimp, which was delicious. Again the seasoning was really good. The other entree was grilled salmon with a dill sauce. This also was very tasty. The sides were cheese grits, gumbo, slaw and sautéed squash and zucchini. The finale was an apple cobbler with ice cream. Delicious and huge! All in all it was a delightful meal!"
150 & Main,2,"So I decided to finally try 150 & Main. As I walked in, I noticed that no upgrades had been made to the inside of the restaurant which is a bummer. This is like the 3rd or 4th restaurant in this space, but no one wants to redo the inside or the outside either. It has too much wood and the paint colors are drab. It reminds you of a log cabin so it isn't very welcoming in a sense. I got there during happy hour time so decided to sit at the bar. Not sure if it was because it had just opened a month prior or what, but usually when you sit at a bar, you are almost immediately greeted and unfortunately I wasn't but it wasn't packed either. It seemed like the bartenders were unorganized. Adding to not being greeted in a timely manner, I finally had to ask the bartender for a menu. The happy hour menu is nonexistent. Not sure how this restaurant is going to make it with out some type of deals because it is competing with other restaurants in that area that's been open for a long time. I finally decided to get a glass of wine which the bartender said it was $5 some it was happy hour but I ended up paying $8. Also the bartender wasn't sure what exactly was on the happy hour menu. For food, I ordered grilled shrimp with a side of collard greens and broccoli. The food actually tasted well since it was very seasoned but the food was cold. I slightly told the bartender, but also told her not to worry, that I will eat it cold and I guess she was ok with that. I really just put it in a to-go box and warmed it up later. I probably won't be back."
150 & Main,5,"We've been here twice and the food is really good, and the service is friendly! It's never been super busy, possibly because the location is a little weird to get to. But the restaurant is comfortable, and the employees seem to care about doing a great job. Will definitely keep coming back!Hot tip - get the chicken tenders!!"
150 & Main,4,Came in mainly to try the bar. However the Bar doesn't open until dinner. You have to request rolls for the table. Manager introduced himself that was a plus The service was great. Food came out in a timely manner. I will be back
150 & Main,3,"Tonight was our third time to eat at this restaurant. The first two visits were better than this one. We were seated immediately. After a few minutes, a wait person came by to take our drink orders. I ordered a can beer, but my husband ordered a draft. When he ordered the draft, the bartender happened to be walking by and immediately said they were out of the draft my husband wanted. Then the bartender rattled off at least three other beers they didn't have tonight. My husband asked if there was anything in their place and was told no. Strange to be out of fur draft beers on a Friday afternoon. After we got our beers, we watched the wait staff walk around - and even two or three passed our table three/four times but did not ask if we were ready to order. Finally, one wait staff worker stopped at our table and asked if we had been waited on. We replied no, and she said she would wait on us. I was sitting facing the kitchen, and the wait staff were congregating in the kitchen chatting. It was early, and the restaurant had only a handful of patrons. Thank goodness the food was good, and the person who finally waited on us was attentive.This is an addendum to above post I made last night...hubby and I both had same food, and today we both had diarrhea.  UGH!"
150 & Main,4,"Visited on a week night. Seated immediately, not many other guests. We ordered the hush puppies for an appetizer. They were very tasty, would definitely order again. I got the buffalo cauliflower tacos with a size of grits. The cauliflower was breaded well and had the right amount of kick. I did ask for some extra ranch because they needed a bit more sauce. Grits were creamy. The service was great! I wish I remember our waiters name! He was attentive and kind. The staff worked together to make sure our food got to us quickly."
150 & Main,3,"This was our first time at this restaurant and I'm sorry to say that it was mediocre.   SERVICE:  Our waiter was friendly but didn't offer bread.  We had to ask for sweetener for our tea.   FOOD:  The food was OK--flavorful, but not superb.  I had the shrimp and grits, which came with lots of sauce and minimal shrimp.  The grits were a soup-like consistency that dripped through the tines of my fork.  Very hard to eat, especially since there were no spoons.  My husband had the catfish and was very disappointed.  The fish was soggy and didn't have much flavor; he said the fries were good though.OTHER:  The layout is nice.  There's a fireplace and a nice sized bar. The restaurant isn't large with three separate eating sections. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a lot of attention paid to the details.  For example:  There was a spilled drink on the floor when we arrived.  It had a ""do not fall"" sign near it, but nobody cleaned it up the entire time we were there, despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy.  Even the manager stepped around it a few times.There have been two other restaurants at this location in the past 10 years.  It is in a great location, but they need to step up their game if they want to survive in such a competitive food market.  We would eat here again if we were with friends who suggested it, but it is probably not a restaurant that we would choose."
150 & Main,2,"Menu was intriguing. Food was good. Service was abysmal. We went in to celebrate my mom's 85th birthday and shared that on our reservation and with the waitress. She was in a hurry to take our order, but never checked on us except to bring our check. I asked for another soft drink, and she brought it into a to go cup. Never even offered dessert. The poor service (""server 20"")will keep us from going back.  Very disappointing, especially for a special occasion."
150 & Main,2,"First and last time... My wife and I wanted dinner and typically we would go to firebirds because it's  consistent however in my way there I saw that this place was open so we decided to give it a try .. Well  when we pulled up it didn't look to be open because the sign wasn't on in the window and it was dark inside, so I walked to he front door to see.  Ordered a strip cooked medium  which came out rare and the seasoning was burned on the steak so it had a weird burnt taste . The bartender  asked if everything was  ok and I showed him the steak which was undercooked . He said do u want me to put it back in the grill for you ????????? I said no thank u because again the seasoning was burnt . No manager came  by to say hey sorry or anything . It's not like I was looking to get a free steak but a manager coming over would have been nice.  They could do a better job on their sides also $4 for 4 asparagus stalks as a side up charge. Maybe they are trying to make money while they can ..However they have a good bourbon selection!!!"
150 & Main,5,"My bridal party and I visited this Resturant for lunch on a a Friday. The customer service is Phenomenal! Parking is not an issue. The food is incredible!! The menu is accommodating for vegans and offers a variety of options. The fried green tomatoes are so delicious! The Resturant is very spacious, nice seating, has a wood burning fire place that is cozy during winter. The bathrooms were spacious and clean. Although I didn't visit the bar, the bar is huge and has several options! This place is definitely a good spot for Friday night food or just good lunch. Definitely recommend! And I'm going back to try various options on the menu!"
150 & Main,1,"Service was as aweful as the food. Salmon that tastes like chemicals (sent back), rotted broccoli (sent back), only 8 shrimp on my plate and no cocktail sauce. When the manager came around we let him know and showed him the aweful and missing food, he was very nice and apologetic (unlike our waitress). And when the bill came, we were charged full price for disgusting food, except for the salmon, they took that off. Never coming back there again. I give them less than 6 months, if that long. With Birmingham being such a diverse and upcoming foodie town, this is an embarrassment. Save your time and money and go somewhere else."
150 & Main,3,"Food was mediocre. Service is slow. Our food came out and we didn't have silverware. It took a good couple of minutes to track some down. Waiter coouldnt find any.  potatoes  were all barely room temperature and soup Was cold. The table next to us had the same problem with cold food. The waiter was nice so that was a plus but with the average price being $22/meal, it better be great. They are going to have to get it together if they are going to stay in business. What a shame."
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"BEST MAC 'N CHEESE I've ever eaten. Plan to wait because it's packed. The menu changes daily. Being from Colorado, it was amazing to taste authentic soul food. It was so worth the time and money. Drinks come with your meal. Also, the people were so kind and helpful."
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,4,"Everything that you would imagine that goes into a small soul food place, this place had it. Hard workers, big fans, sweet tea and really good homemade food. We ordered the fried chicken, fried catfish, mac and cheese, broccoli with cheese and fried green tomatoes. Everything was great!This place had no frills so don't expect getting catered too. It's a small place with no AC So I can only imagine how hot it can get. Which is a great reason to load up on their sweet tea and lemonade to cool you down. It has long communal tables so be nice and try not to sit right in the middle because it does get crowded. Menus are taped to the walls and each day there's something different.Definitely worth the stop when in Alabama!"
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,4,"Alabama southern cooking with high octane sweet tea! If you blink your heads you'll miss the place. Fortunately, I found the restaurant on yelp.  Ok... it might not be the most elegant establishment, but it makes up in the food and southern hospitality.  Located just a few miles from the military base. As I sat down to dine, I could quickly tell this was the locals favorite spot.  I will be returning!"
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"Hands down the best southern cooking you can buy. Everything we had was amazing - fried chicken, fried catfish and smothered pork chops- plus the Mac n cheese - cornbread - even the lemonade and sweet tea were fantastic. Can't be beat."
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"I knew we were in the right place when I saw displayed on the wall:Deuteronomy 28 v 6 !!Real home cooked meal.Scratch kitchen no airs n Grace's, ""just the facts m'am"".Daily specials.Please see menu.We chose the fried chicken 2 pieces done beautifully moist crisp outside 3 sides, corn bread includes cold drink e.g. ice tea un or sweet 21 bucks a couple dine in.Served cafeteria style, pay, take your own seat or carry out.Condiments include pickled chili peppers in vinegar a perfect foil to the fried stuff.Collard greens, okra, especially good.Wife said her fried green tomatoes were 'really yummy '.Family biz.Efficient and friendly helpful staff.Located near gates of Maxwell AFB.Local following. Off the tourist radar.Value.Quality.Earns full marks & hard to beat at this price point."
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"I have been to plenty of places featuring their respective versions of Southern food. Most do a pretty good job; some are pretty disappointing. But every now and then I come to one that makes me think, ""Man... All those other places I've been to are crap."" Mrs. B's serves the kind of Black Southern cooking that makes you think about your own grandma's kitchen when you were younger, assuming she could cook.My favorite part of this meal, honestly, were the greens. It is a personal mission of mine to find the best greens at any new place I visit. And it counts as my vegetables for the day. (lol.) Most are okay but just not as flavorful as what Mrs. B offered me. It wasn't at all too salty like a lot of people mistakenly do, and it came with a nice big hunk of ham (maybe neck) that was so satisfying to slurp the juices off of.Another great thing about this place: the price. For only $10 I received two pieces of dark meat fried chicken, REAL cornbread (muffin), greens, Mac & Cheese (also friggin' amazing), and sweet tea. I honestly would've paid more because it was so good, and I had mine to go."
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,4,"Great southern cooking. I had the chicken with rice and gravy, greens, yams and Mac n cheese. Wasn't a fan of a Mac n Cheeae but everything else was great."
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"Yum! Best home cooking I've had in a long time. Definitely not upscale decor and it's community seating. But that doesn't change the fact that the food is amazing! Fried chicken, fried green tomatoes and butter beans were spot on. Hubby had Salisbury steak with rice, gravy, Mac/cheese, and Lima beans. We were stuffed when we left. Don't let the outside fool you into thinking you won't be welcome. The servers are full of joy and smiles all around. Can't wait to come back."
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"When I came here (from Connecticut), it was my first time in Montgomery, AL. Mrs. B welcomed my boyfriend and I immediately. She was so warm and pleasant! She was very sure to let us know that she actually cooks her food, which I was so happy to hear! Too many times in New York (my Home before CT) you go to restaurants like this and the food is just made by some random cook. No authenticity at all!Now to get to the food. Holy cow! I've always heard myths about southern food, but bro. This food was past amazing! Her ingredients were phenomenal. I honestly wasn't expecting it when the BF brought me here. I saw it and said ""this is the place you were talking about??"" We don't typically see houses as restaurants up north, so I was kind of confused. Lol. Boy was I in for a surprise. The mac and cheese was insane!The okra and rice and beans were to die for! Then, the best part...THE YELLOW CAKE!! Smh. After this meal, we went home and passed out for 3 hours. That was the best food coma I'd had in yeeeeears! Seriously. Definitely try this place if you come in this area. Don't pre-judge the place from the outside. Yes, it's a very cute southern house on the outside, but the inside has amazingness brewing"
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"Five-star soul food and nothing less, in my opinion. I was traveling south on I-65, on the way to the beach after visiting family in Birmingham and decided I wanted some soul food/home cooking. As a clichéd Southerner, me craving this type of food was not out of the ordinary, but me lucking up on such a good place so conveniently located definitely was. As usual, I used my trusty Yelp app. Yep, Yelp is life. It did not let me down, once again.I was traveling alone and one of the benefits of my newfound singleness is choosing when, what, and where I want to eat almost all of the time. That's exactly what I did. My Yelp app not only recommended this place, the directions led me straight to the door. It was a Monday at lunchtime and the people making their way in to this humble restaurant gave me have faith that the reviews were spot on. They were. Outside and in, it's down home all the way. Don't let the outside fool you or keep you from going. Unless you're pretentious, high maintenance, or don't like soul food, I don't see how you can go wrong here. I was in the mood for some fried fish. When I got in there and made my way to the stream table line, I saw that, in addition to fried white fish, they had fried catfish. Yep, sold! Catfish is my favorite. The only problem is that catfish can be a gamble; it always seems to be either really good, or really bad. Well, they nailed the catfish, along with everything else that I tried. The catfish was cornmeal breaded, as it should be. It was light, not greasy, and perfectly golden-fried. I also tried the fried green tomatoes, and they were breaded just like the catfish and again, perfectly fried and delicate. Now, I couldn't walk away without greens and yams, so I also ordered collards and candied yams. The greens were seasoned properly and the yams had the proportionate amount of spices, butter, and brown sugar; they were properly candied, in other words.The staff was friendly and efficient and kept the line of hungry customers moving right along because Southerners have short lunch breaks too. I was in no rush since I was traveling, but the restaurant soon became full of civilian workers and hungry souls from Maxwell Air Force Base. Mrs. B's is definitely a popular place, and rightfully so. I don't always repeat places when traveling, as there are so many places and too little time in my opinion, but I will definitely stop back here the next time I'm in Montgomery. Other local places are just going to have to wait. I'm ordering the same exact meal with an extra piece of catfish for later!"
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,Spectacular!  Great food and lots of it. The collated greens were only surpassed by their Mac n cheese. Their menu changes daily specials. Closed Saturday's. Plenty of parking.
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"You can't get better home cooked food from a restaurant than this.  It isn't ""fancy"" but it exceeds every expectation you could have.Need some food for the soul?? Stop at Mrs. B's!!"
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,We had wonderful pancake breakfast at this little hole in the wall restaurant.  Lunch menu looks just as good.  This will be a regular stop on our way through Montgomery
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,Just excellent. True southern cooking. Make sure you stop here. Homecoming at it's best.
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"We were visiting Montgomery during our road trip. Eating here was worthwhile the examples, it does hit the ball of the park. Amazing food and outstanding menu that changes every day. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. We had the ox tail that was cooked at perfection, and the Turkey wings that were savoury and delicious. We also ordered some red velvet cake, amazing flavour. You can tell that everything is home made with love and passion. Highly recommend."
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"Incredible! This place is hands down the highlight of our weeklong trip in the south across TN, AL, and LA. Pretty unassuming on the outside but the food is scrumptious and enough to prove that southern cuisine goes so much beyond BBQ ribs and fried chicken. Any out of towners passing through should give this place a try - you will not be disappointed!!"
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"I just want to say that it is worth it.Large portions of veggies.My husband and I shared the following:Fried chicken CatfishBbq ribsFried green tomatoes Cream/fried cornCollardsGreen beans Lima beansCorn bread & drink come with your mealI do not love sugar in my corn bread or greens. However, it is a personal flaw of mine.Enjoy!!The pictures of the building on yelp confused us. They may have two locations, but the one on Air Base blvd is the orange building and not the blue house."
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"Hands down the best fried chicken I had in Montgomery! My husband had the smothered pork chop and loved it. My sister said the ribs were some of the best she has ever had. But even more enjoyable than the food were the warm and friendly personalities of the staff. My only complaint is inside is like a sauna, so we sat outside to eat and they don't have butter for the rolls. But the effervescent staff made up for any shortcomings. I wish I lived in Montgomery and I would eat here every day!"
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,"Best meat loaf I ever had!! Hot dang! Great soul food, definitely a home cooked meal. So glad someone recommended this place to me - will definitely return. Solid macaroni and cheese, too!"
Mrs Bs Home Cooking,5,If you are looking for a good home cooked meal this may be the place for you. This is not a fine dining establishment. But this place is a hidden gem. Excellent food that will remind you of your grandmothers Sunday lunch.
Stockyard Grill,5,Well... I have to say when we pulled up I was slightly worried I had picked the wrong place to celebrate my sons graduation from OTS. We walked in and I felt like I was at Jackie in Nipomo! 10oz rib eye and shrimp for $16? Wait a minute... when the food cane I didn't even take a picture of it... dove right in and was not disappointed with the seasoning on my rib eye. The shrimp was tasty and the homemade ranch dressing on my side salad was just as good. Stop here! It's worth your while!
Stockyard Grill,4,"Decided to go to this spot for lunch after my husband's procedure.  I had never been here before but he had, and since he hadn't had anything in a day or so due to he couldn't eat anything before the procedure, I decide to take him here because he seemed like he wanted to go. Was greeted by the staff at the door, the workers were very friendly. Now this is not a joint that I would usually eat at but the food was great...... Hubby ordered a 20 oz. Steak with fries,  while I got the steak salad..."
Stockyard Grill,5,"If you want a good southern meal, this is the place for a meat and three including a drink. They also have burgers and steaks. If you get there before 11:15am you can probably walk in after that you will have to sign in and wait. The health department score was 99."
Stockyard Grill,4,"We stopped here for lunch on the way to NOLA as an interesting alternative to fast food. It's definitely a restaurant in a working stockyard/auction barn, which is kinda interesting to check out... but FYI the whole building smells a little funky. Didn't bother this country girl. I ordered the cheeseburger. I usually feel like all burgers taste more or less the same, but this one was different and super tasty. Wish I knew what was in their seasoning blend! My husband had the prime rib sandwich, which was also tasty - the meat was tender, but for his taste it was way overseasoned. Lots of salt and LOTS of pepper. Friendly, no-nonsense service, lots of locals lining up for lunch. Recommended!"
Stockyard Grill,5,"Man O Man, I'm so glad, that we stopped here, I had one of the best ribeye's I have every eat..."
Stockyard Grill,5,The burgers were great staff was awesome.  They knocked out our burgers even though we came just a minute before closing.  Will be back
Stockyard Grill,5,"We stopped by this little joint while on a road trip and it was like finding hidden treasure.Three minutes off the interstate, it is easy in, easy out. The staff are super friendly (think old south), and our hostess, in particular, made us feel welcomed.The food though...wow! We had a double cheeseburger and the catfish basket. The burger was amazing--juicy, and fresh with flavor bursting out of it like fireworks; easily one of the top 2 or 3 burgers I have ever had. The catfish was equally great as it took me back to the church fish fries of my youth.  The only thing missing was cheeses grits and the pastor walking around greeting everybody.If you have a few minutes to stop by you won't regret it. If you live in the area but have never been, then you are missing out. I miss it already, but I will be back, guaranteed."
Stockyard Grill,4,"Came here based off of a recommendation from a friend.  He spoke about this amazing steak sandwich that is so popular that the line to get in is always long as they're open on weekdays between certain lunch hours.I typed in the address into Google Maps and as I arrived to the location I thought to myself "" this can't be it...?""  Upon arrival I met up with my group and was told they were in the back room.  Being my first time in the establishment, I hesitantly walked through what looked like an 'employee only' area to find a back room with more seating.  I didn't even look at the menu and asked for the steak sandwich.  The server told me it comes with 5 fries (weird) and asked if I wanted an entire basket but I told her I was good with the 5.  This burger patty was well seasoned and the steak was juicy and tender!  The meat to bread ratio was 2:1. It was SO GOOD! The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the audible sticky noise my boots made as I walked on the carpeted area in the back room.  The cleanliness of the establishment is questionable but most hole in the wall places have the BEST food."
Stockyard Grill,5,Some of the best steak and prime rib in Montgomery. They are only open for lunch and make sure you get there early as they quickly become packed full of people. The food is great and the prices and excellent. Make sure to save room a slice of buttermilk pie.
Stockyard Grill,5,"If you close to south Montgomery...stop here for lunch! Their ribeye sandwich is simple but fantastic.  Their lunch specials are a meat and three, plus, plus and they look good, but I can't be here without having a steak sandwich. Maybe I should actually order a lunch special and have a steak sandwich for dessert."
Stockyard Grill,5,"Beef. It's what's for dinner. And OMG you're gonna love it. I had the ribeye special and added grilled onions and mushrooms. It was cooked perfect, I only wish there had been more than 10 oz. Luckily, you can special order steaks to go and have them cut to the exact thickness you want; we left with 5, 1- 1/4"" ribeyes and they threw in a sampling of their special steak seasoning! I didn't try much on this visit, but if everything else is as good as the steaks....wow"
Stockyard Grill,2,"So everyone I worked told me what a great place this was. I do not get it. As far as the burgers go, it does not hit the ball at all, in fact, it is not even in the park. Fresh meat, nah, I believe it is the same tasteless frozen patty you get from the Costco freezer in the 100 count box. Served on a stale bun with withering toppings makes for a really poor experience. Of course the fries were special, frozen crinkle cut that should have been left in the fries a few more minutes. All 10 of the fries were under cooked. The whole meal was served by a waitress wearing a filthy t-shirt with the gentle demeanor of a trash collector....maybe because she was. Now I would like to say that my burger was the exception. But three in our group had the burger and we all agreed it was perhaps the sorriest excuse of a burger served in Montgomery. Two stars are for the atmosphere alone. I doubt very seriously if I will ever be back. Too many other choices in the area for burgers to pay for this stuff."
Stockyard Grill,5,"This no-nonsense restaurant was really a treat. The burgers and fries were absolutely delicious, and the staff were all very friendly."
Stockyard Grill,5,"They are only open from 10:30 - 2:00 and closed Saturday and Sunday. It is an actual stockyard with a small cafeteria-style side room.  We arrived right at 12:00 but only waited about ten minutes for a table. Apparently this is a local go to. Husband got the Dam burger, served on Texas toast with lettuce, tomatoes and pickles.  He was very impressed. I ordered the steak sandwich, which comes on a hamburger bun, and it was very tender and tasty. No condiments needed. Steaks are a tad on the salty side but not too overpowering.  Service was just ok. If we are traveling through this area again during lunch we would definitely consider eating here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to family and friends."
Stockyard Grill,5,Had a bite of the he dam sandwich and dam it was good and the roast with gravy hhmmCan't do wrong with anything you order here. It smells great and taste amazing
Stockyard Grill,3,the food is good but the service ... Today was my first time trying stockyard for lunch I had heard sooo much about this place that the food was good and so on. So me and my coworker decided to try it. Now I hate that I have to bring race into this but... I am Latina and my coworker is an African American women. they took our drink order and brought it back. We got styrofoam cups. I didn't think much of it but then my coworker pointed out everyone else had ... regular plastic cups. then we noticed a young black gentlemen walk in ... he got a styrofoam cup too. Then a white male came in ... regular plastic cup. The presentation of my food was sloppy ! And the guy behind us got the same thing and his was clean and a bigger portion ... when he ordered the same thing has me . He was white. the waitress was nonchalant. I'd say thank you and to her back to me she's say welcome. My first time going and possibly my last
Stockyard Grill,2,"Stockyard was okay, but I honestly don't know where all of the rave reviews come from.  I hit dives and restaurants all across the country, and this one missed the mark.  Nothing except the beef was actually cooked or prepared in house.  Lots of pre-frozen, bagged or canned sides.  The meat was good, but not impressive.  At least it was cheap."
Stockyard Grill,1,I eat here for lunch last week. This was my first time and my last. I had the stockyard salad.Worst salad I have ever tried to eat. The steak it was served with was brought out cold. I had peach cobbler for desert. The cobbler was cold too. Much better places around Montgomery to eat lunch!!! Don't go here!
Stockyard Grill,5,Such a great place to grab a bite. Stopped in here a few weeks ago and couldn't believe how good it was. Some serious Southern cooking! The place was packed. Every table was full yet our food came out in 10 minutes or less! The owners take pride in what they make as they were there working and talking with everyone. Absolutely worth the trip over if you are hungry. Try the Dam sandwich!
Stockyard Grill,5,"Lunch time and get a conversation started about wind, solar,  and indoor farming.Great Food!"
Cork & Cleaver,5,"Our FIRST dine in restaurant post ""rona"" reopening.  Cork and Cleaver is an easy detour from the Interstate when traveling and trying to get a good meal.On our first visit on a Sunday mid afternoon, Hunter gave us great service.  I had the shrimp tacos which had some of the most delicious fried shrimp I've had in a long time and Schweety loved his burger with fries.  Fresh ice tea round off the meal and we were on the road again.Wednesday afternoon we were headed the other way and decided to stop again since we had such a great experience the first time.  This time we called in our order and it was ready within minutes of us arriving at the restaurant.  Another burger for Schweety, this time the Sunrise Burger with and egg. Another hit!I had the lunch size Wedge salad.  Lots of blue cheese, bacon and cherry tomatoes on just the right amount of romaine (not iceberg which was OK with me)  Adam was our server this time and he was also quick and efficient!We are so glad we found you, Cork and Cleaver!"
Cork & Cleaver,3,"After the Alabama Bicentennial Parade we were looking for something to eat and came up with Cork & Cleaver. We arrived at opening time and were one of the first to get seated. From the outside it's located in a strip mall type setting, but is kind of on the back side. There is some outdoor seating available, but not today just a little on the cool side. Indoor seating is plentiful and they have a few curtains that it looks like they pull around so that they can section off some space for small events/parties. Our waitress got to us quickly and took our drink orders. The menu isn't huge, but has all the staples you'd want in a place like this. They have some sandwiches in the $10 - $15 price point range. They also have some entrees (that sound really good) that come in at greater than $20.00. All of us went with burgers, which kept it simple. I went with the Classic Cork Burger. This comes with 8oz pure Angus, romaine, tomato, red onion, pickle, chedder on a brioche bun. Additionally, I had them add bacon. Really, glad I did because otherwise it really was kind of bland. Not that it was bad, the patties are quite large and pretty juicy, just nothing really stood out with it. In addition to that a few people ordered the Cowboy burger. They all liked it, and the jalapenos added some kick to the burger. The problem with these were that the one my fiance ended up with was actually not cooked all the way. It was requested as medium well and came out at medium rare. Really way too under-cooked. They were nice and made it right, but it was a long wait for our food and we didn't really want to have to wait longer for a replacement.While we were there we noticed that they looked exceptionally under-staffed. Not sure if somebody called in sick, but the entire place was being handled by the one waitress. She was really doing a great job, considering the number of people that were there, but everyone was having to wait because it was far too crowded for one person to try and take care of. Based on our experience, I think we would probably try other locations in the area if we were going to be back in the area again."
Cork & Cleaver,4,"Came here on a random Tuesday night after work and I sat at the bar. College basketball started tonight so I was delighted that they had a TV showing the Kansas-Duke game. I order a cup of chicken vegetable soup over rice and the Shrimp & Grits. I was advised to try the Conecuh Sausage while in Alabama and this place has this sausage in there Shrimp & Grits entree. The prices were reasonable and for a Tuesday night,   they were busy. My food came out in a timely manner and it was awesome. Adam, the bartender, was great as well. The little old lady sitting next to me at the bar,  said that I should've gotten the Fried Green Tomatoes, however tomatoes aren't my ""thing,"" but this appetizer seems to be a local favorite. This place was definitely worth the 16 minute drive!"
Cork & Cleaver,3,The place was smaller than I imagined but that gave it a neighborhood feel. The service was attentive and friendly. The food was okay. My wife got two sides. Brussels sprouts were excellent. The risotto was good but tasted like it was rice mixed with cream more than a traditional risotto preparation of slowly stirring in a broth with the creaminess coming from the break down of starch from the rice. I could be wrong but that's my take. I had the burger. It was fair. I ordered medium and got well done. The patty was flavorless. The fries must have been cooked in oil not up to temperature because they were soggy and limp. It could have been an off night. I will give them another try.
Cork & Cleaver,4,"They are open for brunch. Food was a little spicier than expected. The tacos had raw tomatoes, I think it took away from the flavor of the actual taco. The hash was really good, but still had a little more kick than expected."
Cork & Cleaver,4,"Love! Love! Love this place. I haven't written a review in so long but I must write one on this place. The service and the food were fantastic.I think my servers were LeAnne & Alex AND they are the very best. My drink...the strawberry basil lemonade was tart & tasty. The appetizers...fried green tomatoes with crawfish remoulade and pork belly biscuits...OMG! These were amazing. Skip the ribeye sandwich...no seasoning. GET THE SALMON! Add Chardonnay butter. Don't forget your sides...sweet potato fries, fingerling potatoes, and the macaroni & cheese (and I never recommend the mac&cheese but here, GO FOR IT).I will definitely be returning. Thank you Yelp!"
Cork & Cleaver,4,"Should be 3 Star but I do not want to take away from the food. The Food is absolutely delicious! Grump Shrimp were awesome, the crab cake was meaty and flaky. The Only complaint (with food) it that the sausage was not fully cooked in the shrimp and grits. 1 STAR  on the service, we were sat immediately but waited 5 minutes b4 we knew our server, another 8 minutes before getting our drinks and 7 more minutes for food. A lot of time for a medium burgers After receiving my food (from the host not waitress) my husband had to get up find Salt pepper and hot sauce. NO ONE CAME BACK TO THE TABLE. I Ordered bottom less drinks but was only able to receive one. My daughter never received a refill to her lemonade nor did my husband get a refill on his sweet tea. 10 minutes to pay our tab. POOR POOR service! I like this place and is willing to give a second chance."
Cork & Cleaver,1,"Tried to eat at Cork&Clever tonight. Went inside and we were seated and told our server would he with us shortly...shortly never came. Instead we watched the two tables around us be served with drinks (one table twice with drinks), and their food orders taken while we just sat there. After probably 10 minutes of waiting, the wife actually set a timer on her phone for 5 minutes, in that 5 minutes still no one came. At this point we decided to leave. As we were leaving another customer attempted to stop us while 2 waitresses and the lady who seated us stood at the door talking, not even acknowledging that we were walking out past them. That was my first and last experience with Cork&Clever"
Cork & Cleaver,4,Came here on a Saturday for lunch. They weren't very busy and we were promptly seated. The service was so so. We had to wait for a long time until we got our appetizer. They did end up giving us our second round of drink free for the trouble which was very nice. We had the Loaded Old Bay Fries for the appetizer and they were very tasty but I feel like the portion size was a bit small. I had the Blueberry Mule which was very flavorful and fresh. I also had the Pumpkin Pirate. It definitely surprised me because the pumpkin flavor came through very well. My entree was the Cowboy burger and it was very tasty but I feel like some of the components overpowered the others. I also had brussel sprouts for my side. They were ok but were lacking seasoning. My friend's Lobster Mac n Cheese was delicious. Overall a cool place with good cocktails.
Cork & Cleaver,5,"On a random Sunday night, my sister and I happened to be passing through Montgomery after spending quality time with extended, never having met them before family. My sister introduced me to the concept of ""Yelp Roulette."" When in an unfamiliar city, randomly just picking a place without a whole lot of research, that's Yelp Roulette. We chose Cork and Cleaver. It was amazing. Bella did a great job of explaining the beers and specials, but we both settled on the snapper special. It was absolutely fantastic. Well balanced and perfectly seasoned, it also had an accompaniment of rice and sautéed vegetables. All was done to perfection. Then, dessert. At the tail end, Bella mentioned the cheesecake, topped with peaches. My sister, who makes cheesecakes, proclaimed it better than the Cheesecake Factory and better than the best cheesecake in New York City. Everything was fantastic and the price was a bit below our expectations. She and I are pretty picky when it comes to dining, but Bella and Cork and Cleaver hit it out of the park."
Cork & Cleaver,4,"Solid place to go for a good meal and a drink. I stopped in, looking to grab the ribeye, but the burgers looked too awesome to pass up. I wasn't disappointed. The sweet potato fries were tasty, with a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar that was a nice break from the usual seasoning places put on them. I washed it all down with two really tasty beers. The whole meal indicated that the owner and/or chef created a menu with pride, not just by following the corporate template. Great staff - they were friendly, competent, and attentive. Overall, it was nice to get away from the chain restaurant vibe and visit a truly local place. If you're looking for a place to grab a nice bite. It would be an awesome place to bring a special someone, if that's your thing."
Cork & Cleaver,4,"We came in with a large party, so we were expecting a long wait but it was much longer and we also made the mistake of coming for Sunday brunch. With no waiting area we stood outside in the parking lot over 45 minutes because the space inside was way too small. However we were held over with bottomless mimosas and food was great once we got to eat. I ordered the steak and eggs; it was extremely flavorful with the hollandaise sauce, spinach and side potatoes. We also ordered a loaded potato appetizer which was so amazing and highly recommend!"
Cork & Cleaver,4,"Good food, very large portions and good price. Service is a little slow but expected when the food is not simply reheated."
Cork & Cleaver,4,"Comfortable environment with very friendly staff. Decent selection of ""regional"" beer. A great option for gastropub style dining. The food was original and delicious.Tucked away hide-away for small group get-togethers. I'll definitely be back."
Cork & Cleaver,1,Did not enjoy this place. Our food sat in the window for awhile as the servers walked repeatedly by it until they finally brought it to our table a bit on the cold-side. Had to send it back so I guess they threw it in the microwave. The wings not that much flavor and fries extremely hard either that or they were freezer burnt. I ordered a burger medium it came to the table dry and over well-done. The best part of this meal was the Brussel sprouts. Our server visited our table 2x never got a refill! This was our first time trying this place out. Feeling like it was a mistake.
Cork & Cleaver,5,The food is amazing. Absolutely obsessed with the lamb chops. The seasoning was to die for. I'll be back again!
Cork & Cleaver,4,"We had a large group for Sunday brunch and started with several appetizers for the cable.  The fried green tomatoes and ultimate hash were both excellent.  The crab cake was good but not great.  I make much better at home.For entrees, one did chicken and waffles and the remainder did a burger (hold the fried egg) and old bay fries.  I ordered my burger medium rare and it came out well done. The patty was under seasoned and a bit dry.  I detected no old bay seasoning on the fries. Incidentally, about half the menu has fried egg on it.  Perhaps the chef is trying to control the chicken population?Appetizers far outpaced the mains.The high point was our server who was great."
Cork & Cleaver,4,"We were searching for a place to stop for dinner on our way home from Birmingham and my trusty old Yelp app lead us to this modish little restaurant. We started with the peach chipotle wings, which were as messy as they were delicious.  My hubs ordered the etouffee.  I couldn't decide what to order, so I opted to play it safe and go with the chicken alfredo. It was a good call because I enjoyed every bite, including the sauce and the bread.  For dessert, we chose the white chocolate bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. My hubs said it was some of the best bread pudding he's ever had and I enjoyed it as well.  The service was wonderful and the prices were reasonable.   I wish we lived closer because I think this would be a perfect spot to chill on the patio with friends or pets, or friends and pets."
Cork & Cleaver,3,"Stumbled upon Cork & Cleaver while waiting for a table at a nearby restaurant.  Captivated by the menu and ambience, decided to stay and eat here instead.  As it was late morning during the peak Sunday brunch rush, no seats were available inside so we opted to sit outside.  Started with Fried Green Tomatoes (literally the best ever) and followed up with Shrimp & Grits (also fantastic) and a spinach/shrimp/feta omelette.  The food quality was high but the customer service needs some improvement.  Order two Mimosas, but only one came yet both appeared on the bill.  No follow-up after the meals arrived and 20 minutes passed why we waited for plates to be cleared and ask for the check (which we had to do by going inside ourselves).  This may be an anomaly and given the high quality of food, I'll certainly give it another shot but there's certainly room to grow."
Cork & Cleaver,4,"This place is more for lunch or early evening drinks. But also stopped for a Sunday brunch and it was pretty good. Wait time and service is slow but that is just typical for the area. Server was actually very polite and attentive, 5 stars for her effort. Food was very good, crab cake was all crab no fillers and very light. Eggs Hemingway (Benedict with smoked salmon) was also very good. Biscuits were toasted right, good quality and good amounts of salmon. Eggs were perfectly poached for Benedict. Seasoned right, didn't even have to add salt pepper. French toast was average. Good flavor but made with regular thick cut white bread. Pancakes were not good. Bland thick doughy. Coffee comes in small cups $2 each and no free refills, so ended up paying $6 just for coffee."
Central,5,"Honestly, when I first saw the menu, I wasn't thrilled but the magic that the chef creates is amazing. We were a big party so I got to try a lot of different things:Fried Chicken Skins! - at first I thought this would be gross but OMG it was delicious! the batter was simply mouth watering!Cheese and Charcuterie Board - great meats and cheeses (made in house, I think?) the sauces they had on the side was the perfect balance of sweet to go with the cheese.The Pork Belly fries - again wasn't too excited about this one but it proved to be exceptional, like everything else!Ragu Pasta - pasta was made in house and there was so much meat! and it just fell apart as soon as the fork hit it!Brussel Sprouts - PERFECTION! perfect complement for any mealThe wait staff was knowledgeable and attentive and this particular restaurant has a Farm to Table concept which is a rare find in Montgomery, Alabama. Definitely worth it!"
Central,5,"High end, classy place. Good selection with knowledgeable staff. Chef consistently changes the menu, so you can expect a different culinary experience each time. The atmosphere is intimate. You'll walk away with a good sized bill, but you'll be satisfied with your meal and overall experience."
Central,5,"Great restaurant in the heart of downtown Montgomery. The restaurant vibe itself is very nice -- with very high ceilings and lots of wooden decor everywhere, and the service is just as nice. The dishes were also very very good, which I guess is not surprising considering it's one of the nicest/classiest restaurants I saw in the city. I got the grilled salmon, which was done very nicely, and my friend enjoyed their pasta. The cobbler we got for dessert was also delicious! Great place to go for a nice occasion in Montgomery"
Central,5,"We were visiting the Legacy Museum (two doors down) and were starving like no one's business and ""ran upon"" Central. We caught it right before they were closing for lunch. I honestly thought they wouldn't seat us so close to closing, but they did. STAR!The ambiance is dark wood, open kitchen, and high ceilings. It smells amazing in there. We chose a few appetizers because everything sounded so good, we couldn't decide. The fried tomatoes, okra & pimento cheese dish, and cheddar cheese grits (it's a side but were ordered it as an appetizer0 were amazing. I started with a cup of heirloom tomato bisque. Had the right amount of seasoning and not too much cream. Perfect. I had the fish & grits as my entree. UH-MAZ-ING. Nothing was over-seasoned and were the perfect temperature. The vanilla creme brulee was a perfect ending to this lunch. I now want to back to Montgomery and visit to have dinner there!"
Central,5,Excellent service and the food was amazing!!! I will certainly be back.Parking was a little bit of a hassle but they have valet as well...
Central,5,"Stumbled on this place during a trip to the beach. AYelp win. Very cool spot in downtown Montgomery. Pimento cheese appetizer had a nice kick to it. The loaded fried okra appetizer was a nice twist - whole okra, battered & fried with bacon & cheese was yum. The server gave a lot of great suggestions. Several good salads and flatbreads. If I were around for dinner, I'd definitely check it out."
Central,4,"If you're in Montgomery, AL you're probably not expecting to find a classy restaurant on par with those of a bigger city like Atlanta.  If you want a nice lunch or dinner to make you forget you're in Montgomery, make a reservation at Central!  Central is conveniently located in walking distance of many offices, hotels, bars, etc in downtown Montgomery.  They serve upscale Southern inspired dishes with a menu that rotates seasonally.  The first time I visited Central many years ago was with a large group of colleagues.  Our peer who had frequented Central before ordered the pimento cheese telling us that it was phenomenal and a ""must try.""  My first thought was a memory of the store-bought pimento cheese from a plastic tub that had a terrible taste and texture which made me avoid this specific spread ever since childhood.  The appearance of the appetizer looked quite different from that plastic tub of orange goo I remembered.  Between that and the rave reviews I decided to try it.  I have been forever changed.  Now I cannot get enough of some good home-made Southern pimento cheese.The food here is great, and the service is excellent.  Both food and service match the atmosphere of the restaurant."
Central,5,"A must stop restaurant in downtown Montgomery. It is part of ""The Alley"" district in downtown, which is full of shops restaurants, bars, and the Legacy museum.I started off with a 16 oz can of fat orange cat white stout - so good! I wasn't extremely hungry, so I concentrated on the apps. Had the Fett Sow (fat pig) fries. These are thin strips of fried pork belly with a side of peach chutney for dipping - incredibly tasty! Along with this I had the Central fries. These were hand cut fries with a pinch of roasted garlic, parsley, and malt vinegar. Aahhh, such a beautiful thing!I chose to sit outside and dine on this beautiful spring evening. Impeccable service - thank you Raven!!"
Central,4,"Trendy vibes with a bustling lunch crowd. The lunch menu was a bit limited, but the food came out super quickly, which is a great way to cater to the business crowd. The wait staff was polite and attentive.The burger was MASSIVE. Probably a little more food than necessary to be honest, but was delicious nonetheless. The fries were tasty, but overly oily."
Central,5,excellent food. It's actually one of the best meals I had when I was in Alabama. But I found the food in Alabama to be very tasty overall these people really know how to cook.The foodpork chop. Excellent. It was cooked very well and very nice we seasoned. It was also huge and very meaty which I really like. That alone filled me up but the size that came with it were also delicious. It came with a Groton which was delicious all of the portions were very huge though I couldn't finish the meal which really makes me sad because I hate wasting food.Lamb chops excellent very tasty and cooked very well.Succotash was terrible we pointed it out to the waiter and the immediately took it off It really had no taste but we've never had it before so we weren't sure if that was what it was supposed to taste like however given it is a traditionally considered a southern dish we were surprised that it wasn't as impressive as the other foods served.Beet salad very goodWe did not get any drinks.The service was excellent. Servers did everything they could and even the manager came to our table to check on us.Parking is on the street and it's free.ambiance is very nice. The restaurant's very clean bathrooms are very clean. They have interesting decor.Overall I'm glad we had our meal here It was very tasty and very enjoyable.
Central,5,Such a fun place to have dinner with friends or new friends you meet at their creative cocktail bar. Everytime I'm in Montgomery I find my way here for dinner
Central,3,"**Updated review, 9 Nov:  avoid the beef short rib entree--dry like the Sahara Desert!  Quality over quantity--that's what you get when you dine at Central.  If you're looking for a seasonal menu offering local ingredients then this is your place.  I've dined here a number of times and found that I prefer the dinner menu over the lunch menu (like other reviews have noted, the fries are overly oily).  With that said, everything is prepared to order.  Carefully crafted cocktails can start your evening off right while a carefully curated wine selection will guide you through dinner.  Local craft beer is also offered for those interested.  I've had just about everything off of the summer menu.  The ribeye was seasoned perfectly and cooked to an excellent Med-rare.  Every fish dish I have ordered has been cooked superb--fish nice and moist and just glistens when cut.  With that said, every time I dined throughout the the summer the local catch special was grouper.  If that's your special for an entire season then it's not really ""local catch special,"" it's a routine menu item.  Dessert needs some work, but if you're interested--go with the chefs donuts or the creme brûlée.  Either will be a good way to end the night.So if you're looking for great entrees served in a southern classy atmosphere then this is your place.  If you're expecting buffet-style sized portions then this isn't your place and"
Central,3,"I visited on Saturday even about 6. I was in a fairly large group of about 15. The ambiance was very nice, I liked the fact the bar was further into the restaurant and not as soon as you walked in. The wait staff was really nice and accommodating. I felt the menu was a bit pricey and limited too, as a pescaterian I had like two entree options. The cocktails sound very carefully crafted and fun, many in my party ordered them and seemed very satisfied. I had a lot of food here and nothing really blew me away. My entree red grouper was bland for sure. I also had the pimento cheese, which also fell short of my expectations. I think the highlight of my meal was dessert, I had the sweet potato cheesecake and it was really good. I don't know that if I were in Montgomery again that I would return, nothing too memorable about this place."
Central,5,"In Montgomery again for business, I chose to meet a dear friend here for dinner.  I remembered that she said it was her favorite restaurant.  I now know why.Conveniently located in the heart of downtown, Central was a mere five minute walk from my hotel.  It's located in a district that has been re-vitalized by the city, so the atmosphere is astounding!  Walking in, the service was stellar and never receded from that standard.  Quiet and upscale, it was a lovely setting to catch up with an old friend.The dinner selection was amazing and, while I did want to try the steak, my friend recommended the salmon.  Whew.  It was incredible!  Complimented with a creamy risotto, it was extremely tasty and I will gladly recommend it to any patron reading this.While the prices are a bit high and it can get crowded, these drawbacks should not preclude one from trying Central the next time he or she is in Montgomery and looking for an upscale experience."
Central,5,"I stop by here every time I make it to Montgomery, great atmosphere and even better food. Menu is different every time and always excellent. Colleagues from Chicago were shocked at how great it was, never heard of Pimento cheese. Shocking but they loved it. Ribeye was superb and everyone loved their meals. Chicken skin app was great but too greasy for more than a bite, should be expected for what it is though. Even dessert was very good."
Central,5,"This place came highly recommended and I can see why. Upon entering, I was asked if I had a reservation - for a Tuesday evening it was packed. Luckily it was just me and there was plenty of space at the bar.The atmosphere is similar to a gastropub that you'd find in a major city like D.C., but Central obviously doesn't lose it's Southern roots through the rustic finishing touches of wood and even in the staff's uniforms.I sincerely wish I had had room for more food in my body. The scallops were cooked perfectly; very tender, seared the right amount. I nearly held the plate to my face to lick it clean.I indulged in the sweet potato cheesecake, which was equally and unfairly delicious. The homemade marshmallow fluff that it was topped with was sweet enough to give it that extra, ""you'll need to walk 10 miles to burn off these calories,"" without overwhelming the pallet. It paired well with my cabernet."
Central,4,Absolutely love this place!  It is beautifully decorated with a trendy chic vibe.  The service is great and the food is delicious!!  We came here for a quick lunch and later that day for dinner.The foodMeat and cheese plate- amazing!!!  I loved it!!!Fried green tomatoes- southern yum yum!Feta sow fries- omg you have to get this- beyond amazingDuck- very good with unique flavor combinations.
Central,5,After saving up 2 years of retirement money I decided to take the wife out to this fancy pancy place LOLZZ......after spending 173.75$ you would think maybe your sweetheart would reward you after with a nice little reach around.....but again NO. What happened to this country anyways back when blow jobs weren't something you had to ask for but they were given....father used to talk to me about fighting the Germans and the Cummies..now I'm here stuck with my grandson telling me about his hot girlfriend...gheez if I was younger maybe I go for her hahaWife seemed to enjoy the place so good food
Central,5,"Wow ....wow and wow.  In town for work and found this place on Yelp.  Read the reviews and thought I'd give it a try.  Atmosphere - very cool vibe, rustic look with great decorMenu - excellent selection of varied types of dishes Staff - all very friendly and accommodatingNatalie at the bar took amazing care of me.  She took the time to answer all my questions and guide me through the menu.  She was on point throughout.  Had the lamb ribs to start!!!  DAAAAAMN.....they were super good!!!   Highly recommend them.  Pressed beet salad next and wished I'd had ordered two.  Amazing!!!!!   My wife makes fun of me for loving beets.  LoL.  I wanted to order a steak but was actually full so I jumped to dessert.  The lemon meringue pie.  O M G!!!  That may have been the best thing I put in my mouth for a long time!!!"
Central,5,"My wife and I went there to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary. I made a reservations online and specified it was my anniversary. When we got there the entire staff knew why we were there. The hostess, waitress, food server, and what looked like one of the managers all came by to wish my wife and I a happy anniversary. Very nice customer service. Now for the good stuff. The food was AWESOME !!!!!  We started with the fet sow fries. Fried pork belly with a sweet dipping sauce. Delicious. My wife had the special two huge prawns with a tomato basil sauce on a bed of rossetto type rice.  That was good too but the best thing was the 16 oz. ribeye steak with roasted potatoes. Cooked perfectly and one of if not the best ribeye I ever had. Highly recommend. A little pricey but well worth it ."
Sa Za,4,Some of the best Italian options in the walking area. Pizza was amazing Chicken piccata was great Spaghetti and meat balls
Sa Za,5,"Best Italian restaurant in Alabama. Terrific service as well.Loved the grandma salad, meatball appetizer and eggplant parm! Ok I'm weird but don't miss the real NY homemade cannolis."
Sa Za,2,"This place is in a great location but is average at best on the food level.  The bruschetta and shrimp appetizers were decent but lacks robust flavor. The lobster ravioli was great!  The sauce and favor, while still not robust, was good.  Good portion, they have great service  and very attentive.The pace is a great layout with both indoor and outdoor. I wish the kitchen matched the boldness of the space."
Sa Za,4,"Went to Sa Za after work and O-M-G!I'm definitely visiting again & getting the EXACT  SAME  THING!!!! I ordered the Lobster,  Shrimp,  & Spinach over Angel Hair Pasta with the Cream Sauce and an order of 3 breadsticks for $.75! It smelled great and was super tasty. The breadsticks was drowning in butter and garlic sauce and added a dipping marinara sauce for $1. It was moderately busy,  but there wasn't a long wait to be seated or to get my food. I'm definitely going back! (I thought about taking a picture AFTER half of my pasta was eaten.... sorry guys,  next time! )"
Sa Za,5,"Lobster Ravioli was 10/10. Will definitely be back!! Atmosphere is nice! The inside is kinda small, so you may have to wait. We didn't have to though!"
Sa Za,1,"2 minutes agoWe where excited to try this place, we always try and eat local ( I support local and small businesses, because ima a small business owner). The hostess sat us and we sat there for 12 mins and no one asked us for anything.   On our way out the door we explained it to the hostess and bartender. The acted like they didn't care.  Could have been my patriotic themed Nine Line shirt I was wearing The one server that passed our table turned his( or her) nose up at usSo I can't support this incompetence.   Mellow mushroom welcomed us with open armsTony Columbus Georgia"
Sa Za,3,"The server was super friendly, the food was meh. Red sauce is sweet, and the toppings weren't amazing. The chopped antipasto salad had a weird tasting meat on it. The cheese garlic bread was probably the best part but they charge for dipping sauce (marinara and/or Alfredo) which is kind of ridiculous. Over priced. Not amazing."
Sa Za,5,"We needed a last minute reservation for  a large group and this place was perfect. They got us a table and handled the meal and service perfectly. Hannah was amazing! The pizza was really good,  especially the purgatory one with egg. We would've appreciated more local beer on the menu but the service made up for it."
Sa Za,5,"Been here several times. Consistently good food.  Fast, friendly service.  I'll definitely keep coming.  The General Manager, Jeff, knows his menu well and his kitchen's capabilities ... He also doesn't shy away from special requests.  I appreciate the effort team.  When I'm in town for work, it's nice to know I have a good place that I can count on."
Sa Za,2,Had a beer at the outside bar.... asked for a food menu and the bartender never came back to ask if I wanted to order.
Sa Za,3,"Came here on a Sunday night. They have a great location right off the river on a nice strip of downtown. The atmosphere is very industrial. The service was really good throughout the dinner. For my first drink I ordered the Serendipity cocktail. It was alright but nothing too amazing, and reminded me of just a well drink. For my second drink, I had the Super Mojito. It was not my cup of tea at all. It did not remind me of a Mojito in the slightest. It had pomegranate liqueur in it which gave it a weird flavor, it almost reminded me of pickle juice. The cheese sticks with white sauce were very tasty. For my entree I ordered the Boneless Short Ribs which came with potato medallions and a Merlot poached egg. I think it was a good dish but I do not think it was worth the price. The short rib was cooked well but I think there needed to be more than one egg to provide more moisture to the dish. I would give this place another shot but I would order completely different and probably stick to pasta."
Sa Za,4,"Sa Za is located in the Alley along with several other restaurants. The outside is very appealing and had been one of my bookmarks for a while now so my BF and I finally checked the place out on a Friday night. The inside is not exactly small but it seems that way because it is filled with tables that sit closely together and they have 2 large bars. I'm somewhat on the petite side and I had to walk sideways to get to our table and the restroom which was very clean. There is also patio seating available as well.Due to this being an Italian restaurant they had a large selection of 18"" pizzas, salad, and several other options. They offer a seafood special daily which you might have to ask about if the waitress does not tell you during the introduction. The night we dined they were offering a scallop entree. Based upon Yelp reviews my boyfriend decided to go with the Chopped Lobster, shrimp, Spinach over Angel Hair pasta dish ( I'm not sure why they didn't give this dish a actual name but I can only assume they figured the ingredients would wow the customers). My boyfriend enjoyed his pasta dish which had a nice flavor and the ingredients tasted fresh. I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana and was pleasantly pleased with the thinly sliced breaded eggplant covered with cheese and sauce perfectly seasoned & served with a side of penne. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and our food came out fast.We had a great experience at Sa Za. Next time I would like to try out the pizza and the drinks. Definitely date night certified but also a decent place to bring the kids."
Sa Za,5,"Grew up in NYC and currently live in Asheville, NC a real foodie town. Never guessed I'd eat the best pasta dish EVER at Sa Za. Ordered the lobster, shrimp and spinach with angel hair pasta. Just delicious. Big chunks of seafood in a delicious garlic white wine sauce. Our waitress Kiki was so friendly. I'd definitely come here again."
Sa Za,1,"Not the place to go to WITHOUT a reservation!!!Especially over a holiday weekend Friday night!  We were given first a 20 minutes waiting time only to be told it was actually 30 to 45 minutes.  After standing by for over an hour we told them to give us carry-out and the response was Ok now you have to wait another 20 minutes!  20 minutes later guess what?  No carry-out.  Now you tell me,  what went wrong and how should this be settled?  Thanks.  Visitors from out of town simply wanting to try some ""really serious and good Italian food"".Thanks Jeff T for the behind the scenes response.  Also thanks for the offer to try again we're in town ""with"" a reservation.  Think we'll give that a try.  Hope others out there do the same as well.  I'm sure it'll improve your ""bottom line"".  Any chance you'll add an xtra bench or two outside the door for us old or disabled folks to wait for our ""reservation table.  The bar stools are too high and difficult.  Thanks  JaThanks.  Perhaps we will give you a second chance.  See you this weekend!"
Sa Za,5,Had a great meal here -- wonderful place for a good fish dinner in Montgomery.  Recommend it highly!
Sa Za,4,"We loved Sa Za! That is, me and 22 of my best friends. We were all seated at the same table, they got our order right, the food was yummy (outstanding pizza crust with the blend of great chew and crisp finish)--we had three pizzas at our end of the table: Grandma's Sunday sauce (my favorite) with smashed meatballs, a Meat Lover's (jammed with prime protein) and a Chicken Paillard, pesto-y and fresh. Others devoured the lasagna and a huge salad at the other end of the table quickly vanished. Service was stellar. Wine, beer available and a great upbeat vibe."
Sa Za,5,"The mussels, the salad, the pork chops, everything is delicious! Ambience is beautiful too. I'll definitely become a regular soon."
Sa Za,5,Favorite Italian joint. Creamy spinach artichoke dip is fantastic. Must try dish is the Lobster Ravioli - cant go wrong with this!!!
Sa Za,3,"Average food, average service.  Wasn't horrible but nothing to rave about.  Pizza was so unmemorable, I don't remember what I had.  Zero options for some members of our party--zero gluten-free or vegetarian.  They each had the saddest salads, while we ate mediocre pizza."
Sa Za,3,"This place has always been relatively packed when I come to The Alley.  I came on a Saturday afternoon and it was really quiet so I stopped by the outside bar area.  The service was awesome and the staff were super cool and friendly.  I was here in March and the weather was awesome.  It was pretty lively downtown (for Montgomery) and people stopped frequently to the outside bar for a drink.  The pizza was below average, it looked great, smelled great, but the taste was pretty bland.  In fairness I am from Boston and I am a huge pizza snob.  Most people would probably find the pizza amazing.  For me the cheese and sauce were almost none existent flavor wise but the crust was great.  I had friends get the pasta and say it was amazing.  Overall I would recommend this place to anyone in downtown Montgomery looking for a place to have some drinks and dinner with friends (I recommend the outdoor bar area)."
Wishbone Cafe,5,"This restaurant is AMAZING!!! My husband and I were in the area and were hungry so I hopped on YELP and saw WISHBONE as #1. I was far from disappointed. The food was so good from  the appetizer, entree and  dessert. I will definitely be eating here again."
Wishbone Cafe,4,"Amazing cajun food right in Montgomery. I stopped in here for lunch today before shopping and it did not disappoint. It is located in a strip mall but don't let that fool you. The restaurant is set up with a bar and plenty of seating. They had a happy hour menu so it may be a nice place for a date night or to grab a drink.  As soon as I was seated my server brought our a sample of their specialty tea and a sample of the collard green soup. They were both delicious, especially the soup!After looking over the menu I decided to go with the crawfish Julie. It was a very creamy sauce with pieces of crawfish served over rice with a side of toast. This was my first time having crawfish julie sauce and let me tell you this dish was RICH. The size of the bowl was bigger than I expected and with how rich the dish was, I struggled to finish. That being said the sauce was delicious and had enough spice to compliment the crawfish flavor. The service here was spot on and my waitress made sure to check in on me every couple of minutes. All the girls working here were friendly and made me feel welcome. I may have to make a repeat visit before I leave Montgomery."
Wishbone Cafe,2,"Pros: the shrimp on my dish were delicious and service was quick. Saw the great reviews on Yelp. I'm from Baton Rouge so it seemed like a great place to dine. Once we open the door the live music was unbearably loud. We were seated then decided to get our food to go. My wife ordered the crab cakes which are considered a side.  $8 bucks. We should have looked before we left. There were two, the size of silver dollar meatballs and they were salty.   The ketchup container was bigger. I ordered the Bayou Classic.  The rice was undercooked, same small salty crab cakes, sausage looked like hotdogs but the 3 shrimp on the dish were delicious. Also my wife fries were undercooked.  I can not recommend this place.  Even the two ladies who sat across from us complained about the loud music."
Wishbone Cafe,2,"Stopped by for lunch today. First thing I noticed was the food scraps on the floor and some tables still dirty. Only about 6 people in the restaurant dining and it just felt dirty. Ordered a shrimp PoBoy and it came out in an over toasted hot dog bun. What respected Cajun/creole restaurant would serve a PoBoy on a hog dog bun? First time I ate at this restaurant was great. What happened to them. During CoVid restaurants should clean up and perfect what they do, not at wishbone."
Wishbone Cafe,4,"While in Montgomery for work I wanted something good to eat and this place didn't disappoint.The food is seasoned well and flavorful! Their special tea is delicious! And the service is also good. I ordered the bayou classic which is rice topped with crab cakes, shrimp, spinach, and a Cajun cream sauce. It comes with a side of bread too. The portion size is perfect and you can't beat that price($13) for that meal. I don't remember the soup name that I sampled but it was surprisingly really tasty. I would definitely come by here again if I'm ever in town again."
Wishbone Cafe,5,"You know how something fantastic happens when you least expect it?  Like finding a 10 dollar bill lying on the floor?  Or having 2 candy bars fall out of the vending machine?Wishbone Cafe is one of those least expected fantastic things!  Currently located in an unassuming strip mall by a Publix supermarket, this little gem of a restaurant should not be missed!  I say currently however because the owner (I think he was the owner) said that they were in the process of moving the restaurant to a bigger location.  Wherever it is, if you're in Montgomery you should go there!Our party of 4 arrived with no expectations and some hungry bellies.  We were immediately served some samples of tea and a bit of the soup of the day.  The tea was a delicious sweet pineapple concoction.  I'm not normally a fan of sweet teas, but this was cold and delicious.  The soup, vegetable, had a wonderful rich beefy flavor to it.  A great way to welcome us to the restaurant.We started with the quesadillas and wings.  We had the jerk flavored wings.  The quesadillas were good.  The wings were awesome.  Not too spicy but great flavor.  For an entree i had the salad with salmon on it.  Salmon was cooked well.  Everyone enjoyed their meals immensely as the others got shrimp or crab cakes.You know that feeling you get when you're trying to find a place to park at the super crowded mall and a spot opens up right in front?  Yeah, Wishbone Cafe is that magical parking spot.  So go there and try it!"
Wishbone Cafe,2,"I was very disappointed after eating food from here. I am visiting my sister in town and I wanted something really tasty, Yelp led me here. I viewed the prices online and decided to order the Mardi Gras pasta & bayou classic which both were priced about 13-17$ online. When I arrived, the clerk told me my total was 38$ and I checked the to go boxes (which were only half full) and determined that I was not paying 15 & 20$ for such. The pasta's description online read ""angle hair"" pasta but when I opened it I clearly noticed regular spaghetti noodle which was immediately unappetizing to me. I had them removed the 20$ half full container of spaghetti noodle pasta and took the bayou classic. The dish looked good but upon tasting it I felt that the rice was old/hard & cold in the center as well as EXTREMELY SALTY overall. The only reason I have 2 stars is because the crab cake tasted alright. Other than that, I'd never eat here again. Very dissatisfied with their pricing, presentation and product."
Wishbone Cafe,2,"Server said hello with samples of sweet tea and soup which I thought was kind and reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1. Chicken is tough, dry and tastes like was frozen and not fresh."
Wishbone Cafe,5,"Don't let the Yelp map cause you to miss out on this delicious must try spot!  The yelp map took me to the wrong spot even though yelp lists the correct address of 6667 Atlanta Hwy, Montgomery, AL 36117.  Luckily I called and was informed that they are still in business and instructed on me how to get there. It had a Nice atmosphere where I was kindly greeted as soon as I stepped in the door.  I ordered the Bayou Classic which I was highly pleased with.  I started off by tasting each component separately and thought to myself this is not going to be anything more than ok.  I was highly mistaken... it was almost magical to see how good the entree was when eaten as a complete dish.  The signature tea was delicious as well."
Wishbone Cafe,5,"This place is fantastic! If you're in Montgomery, it's a must. Their fruit tea is fantastic, their Collard Green soup is too die for! We had the blue plate specials...highly recommend! Very friendly staff. Chef came by to check in. Will be back for sure!"
Wishbone Cafe,5,Just had an awesome lunch there !!!! First time at the new location. It's gorgeous !!!! So comfortable and interesting. We were given samples of the pineapple tea and collard green soup when we were seated. Delicious !!!I ordered the collard green soup and the lemon pepper wings. Absolutely heavenly. My companion had John Ed's Po'Boy and fries. She was quite happy to the last bite. The customer service was excellent- everyone was so friendly and nice. Definitely a place to go have great food in a relaxing atmosphere without having to deal with the traffic of Eastchase or the parking of downtown. Will be back soon !!!!!
Wishbone Cafe,2,The food may have been good in the past but it is made with cheap ingredients and over powdered with heavy doses of salt to hide the fake imitation crab in the crab cake. The cooks in the back claimed they didn't put fake crab in the crab cake but Im not stupid and the tried to shred it up with real crab. This was found on two separate plates at the table. Was very disappointed but I will say the servers were good but the kitchen has resorted to cheap ingredients to make more money on their food. Sad thing to do with a Southern Staple. Will not return and I will look else where.
Wishbone Cafe,4,"I was visiting from Cali. And a good friend of mine took me to this resturant. The waiter was funny and informative. I loved my food, especially the collard been soup. That soup  was a total same changer for me...BOMB!!!!!"
Wishbone Cafe,4,"We were in Montgomery today and decided to let Yelp find us a place to eat lunch. Boy, did yelp do a great job finding this little gem for us! We ordered the Bayou Classic and the Wishbone Sampler. The Sampler had chicken salad, riblets, and wings. My hubby was in heaven! I sampled one of the riblets and I can see why! They were delightful, with just the right amount of sweet heat in the sauce! The Bayou Classic had two crab cakes, several shrimp, with a Cajun rice with a cream sauce, and two pieces of toast. While it was very good, the crab cakes were lukewarm. That was the only complaint I had.Service was prompt and friendly! Overall, we had a very pleasant experience and will definitely go back the next trip to Montgomery!"
Wishbone Cafe,5,Same great food and friendly service. New and improved location. We went for dinner. There is a real bar now. There was a guy playing drums along with music. Nice vibe but family friendly. Loved the food.
Wishbone Cafe,5,Service was great! Food was awesome! Music was amazing. We could have done without the love bugs but that was our choice to sit outside!
Wishbone Cafe,5,No words that Tea and the I think it's either black eye pea soup or the collard green soup oh my God delicious delicious double delicious oh yeah great staff as well
Wishbone Cafe,5,"Don't judge this book by its tiny cover!C'mon in and bring your own mother!This place has a rather unique twist,Free collard greens soup, you don't dare miss!And a cup of their delicious homemade tea,The price again right, because it's free!But when you crack the cool menu open,That's when your stomach will start gropin'!The girl busted out the Louis Armstrong,I knew right then she'd not done wrong.But I jumped on the Jeffery Darden,Everything included except the garden!We smacked our lips and chomped it down,And now we're saddened without the frown.Because we'd eaten some of the best Mont grub,So get in this place and show some Yelp love!Based on a recommendation we dropped into this place, but did not know what to expect.. It blew the shoes plum off my feet! Such a unique and delicious flavor that makes me wanna eat here all the time!"
Wishbone Cafe,5,"So I was able to visit a place called #WishBoneCafe located in Montgomery Alabama and I honestly have to say, don't let the small building fool you. This place definitely brings the creole cuisine love and flavor from the south authentically. I tried the bayou classic with tilapia and the smoker with a side of jamaican relish and their own sweet tea,EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS. If you are in #Montgomery #alabama please try them out. #dinner #foodie #food #birmingham #fatboy #lunch"
Wishbone Cafe,1,"Disappointing from start to finish. Decided to try this place because of the great reviews. We arrived at 8 pm - an hour before closing - and the place was empty. The employees acted like we were bothering them with our presence and all stood around when the cashier yelled out our order: bayou classic, Louis Armstrong, and a house salad.10 minutes later, our meals were packed up and I drove back to our hotel down the road. When I opened the boxes, the food looked decent. But the crab cakes were cold, the rice was hard and clumped together, and the portion size was underwhelming. Between the service and experience, it's not worth a return trip."
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,"Can't go wrong with that name, turned out to be a great Yelp review choice for a lunch in that neck of the woods. Super moist ribs and super good turnip greens (left compliments on them greens). OK wings, skip the rib tips. Will definitely be a stop if I'm back in that area."
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,"Love this place.Great meat. Great sauce.Great portions. Very good prices !I always see a myriad of people in here. White collar, blue collar, military.......good food attracts everyone !"
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,"What great BBQ and at a great price!! We found Fatman's on Yelp and decided to try it based on the reviews and, who wouldn't trust a BBQ joint named Fatman's?!?! We had the ribs platter (3 ribs, 1 side, drink = $8) and the BBQ pork salad (you could choose either pork or chicken). The ribs were cooked perfectly and had the right amount of pull to them. They were seasoned well with a rub and because they weren't slathered in sauce before serving, they still had some crisp to them. The BBQ pork salad was a good size; it comes with a lot of pulled pork, lettuce, and tomato, and it's only $6. I ended up eating all the salad part and had a few ounces of pork leftover that I brought home. We also had the baked beans and banana pudding. The baked beans are REALLY good!!! IDK what they do, but they are way better than normal. They aren't sickly sweet like some beans can be, but they aren't overly smoky either. You should just try them. The banana pudding was also delicious. It tastes like a really creamy vanilla-banana pudding with some vanilla wafers mixed in. The restaurant is straightforward with no frills. Order and pickup your food at the counter in styrofoam containers and clean up after yourself when you're done. QED"
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,3,Ordered wings and camp stew. Wings were big but not my favorite. Camp stew was tasty. Corn nuggets were the best part. Quick service. Sauces were good. Husband said rib tips were good but I didn't try them. Took his word for it. Can't say I'd go back. But it wasn't terrible. Just not my tastebuds' favorite flavors.
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,3,"I went here for lunch, and convinced a gaggle of people to join me because the reviews were so good. I will say that the prices are pretty great, and the sauce selection was . However I was very underwhelmed with the pulled pork. A friend had the wings (didn't like) and chicken tenders which he said they tasted like they were microwaved. If you want okay bbq, with Incredibly fast service, check it out. Also-they have good banana pudding which you can get as a side with your meal."
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,"Legit!  Flavor is there. Price = super affordable.  Actually, I shouldn't say this but I think their price is too low.  The lunch combo comes with 3 ribs, a side, slice of bread and a drink for $8.50.  Ridonkulous! These ain't no skinny ribs either, you get a meaty portion with a nice smokey taste that will hit your taste buds from all angles.  The location is a bit run down but that's what makes it great.  One day I might try their wings but I am feeling the ribs so I will stick to what I know. Check this place out for a quick lunch. You won't be dissappointed. P.S. make sure your tags and stuff are all up to date, tons of Police eat here. ;-)"
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,4,"It is rare that I will write a review immediately after dining at a restaurant, but in this case I will make the exception.  As I've mentioned in the past, anytime I'm South of Richmond, VA, I always strive to enjoy Southern fare and especially barbecue.  BBQ down south is akin to a religion, where generations of pit masters pass along secrets of specific spice rubs, using only certain purveyors to get their hickory or mesquite logs, and of course, controlling temperatures and cook times to get the perfect crust and consistency of the meat.Let me put this in simple terms - Fatman's Smokehouse is the REAL DEAL.  The interior is basic and reminiscent of a bbq joint from the 50's.  Basic tables with rolls of paper towels, sit on top of a plain floor, dingy lighting, and ceiling fans to cool the otherwise nondescript dining areas.  And when you get your food, it is served on Styrofoam with plastic cutlery. But the ribs - OMFG, they are out of this world ""amazing"".  The ribs have that bark that I'm always looking for in good 'cue, which has a slight crunch, but then quickly gives way to tender succulent meat.  The only slight detraction is that the rub might be a bit too salty...but that's just my taste.    There are a variety of sauces near the drink station, of which I recommend the ""hot"" and the ""white"" sauce.  The ""hot"" sauce is the House bbq sauce with a spicy (but not too spicy) kick to it.  The ""white"" sauce taste like a mix of ranch, light horseradish, and mayo.  It doesn't sound like it would be appetizing, but trust me, you will be surprised at how good it is.I also got the house beans as a side, and a nice bonus is that there are strands of pulled pork mixed in.  The beans have a slight molasses notes  but the smoke flavor helps to temper the sweetness.  But having the pulled pork mixed in with each bite, really elevates the humble beans to awesome side dish.   I don't normally think of Alabama as one of the classic centers of BBQ, but Fatman's has changed my mind.  The ribs here rival ANYTHING I've had in Memphis, North Carolina, and come close to the mecca of Kansas City, MO.  I'm only in town for a few days for business, but I have a feeling I'll be eating here...A LOT!"
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this place !!!!! The food is awesome and the people are so friendly. I order from there frequently and we're never disappointed. It's a diamond in the rough. Be sure and give it a try !!!!!!
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,4,"After being in the south for the better half of my summer I've had the pleasure of trying out quite a few BBQ spots. Fatman's is by far the best.  It's located in a small red building that screams ""good BBQ.""  The restaurant is very clean and the service is friendly and fast. I ordered the pulled pork plate with 2 sides of greens (YUM!) My lunch was only $7 what a steal!  I especially loved how my pulled pork was unsauced so I could sample the different assortments of BBQ sauces made available for use.  I particularly favored the spicy BBQ sauce and the white BBQ sauce. The greens were perfect and delicious. Not to mention the portions were huge! If your looking for a great BBQ spot to grab some grub I'd highly recommend stopping by!"
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,4,"I was starting to lose faith in Alabama BBQ before trying this place out.  The food here was amazing.  I ordered a half rack of ribs and some mac n' cheese.  The ribs were perfectly cooked.  They were tender, but not overly tender like you will find a some establishments.  Also, none of the BBQ came pre-sauced.  If you ever go to a BBQ restaurant and the meat comes pre-sauced this should be a red flag.  The mac n' cheese was good, but nothing special.  I feel that the sides at a BBQ restaurant are often overlooked, but often can set a place above the rest.  They had a wide range of sauces to choose from, but the ""hot"" BBQ sauce was the best.  As someone who loves BBQ and also smokes meat on a regular basis, I had to try the white BBQ sauce to compare notes.  I found it to have too much of a mayo taste.  I think they could fix that by adding more vinegar and some extra spices.  Overall the food was really good and it was nice to finally find a decent BBQ joint here in Montgomery.  This will definitely be a recurring stop whenever I am visiting Montgomery."
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,4,"It was pretty busy when I went, and I order to-go; however, my food was ready in no time. I ordered the BBQ fries & a drink, camp stew, and banana pudding. I really enjoyed the BBQ fries & camp stew. The banana pudding was pretty mediocre though. Overall, I enjoyed my meal."
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,3,"I ordered the rib tips, Mac & cheese and potato salad. The rib tips were tough and very hard to eat, definitely took a lot of sauce and sweet tea to eat them. It was a very large portion though for only $7. The Mac & cheese was ok but the potato salad was the best part of the meal."
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,"Went here for lunch with some friends. Excellent little hole in the wall. Try BBQ place. Not a lot of choices and that makes it great. Owner/manager takes your order while your standing in line, he drops it off and by the time you pay your food is done! Genius! They have a local bbq sauce that is terrific. Food was excellent. All of us got something different and everyone loved it. If you like okra (I don't) apparently it's the best  ever. I got the Mac and cheese and potato salad for my sides. Both homemade and incredible. I went with the pulled pork. Again excellent. The ribs looked good also. If your in the area definitely give this place a shot. Line gets long but moves fast."
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,"Great place... great price.... great service.BBQ pork plate with fries and stew plus drink $7.The portions were plentiful and the taste was delicious. There may be a line, but the line goes really fast. If in town.... great lunch spot!"
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,Fatman's is the best BBQ I've had in town.  Great prices and amazing food.  Definitely left full and satisfied.  Extremely nice staff as well.  I would come here again and again.
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,3,"I went to Fatman's as a vegetarian, which was okay. All my meat eating friends LOVED it! I would have given this place a 4/5, but I found a few pieces of pork in my nachos. The wide variety of sauces was AWESOME!!!!"
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,"Oh my goodness!!  I can't avoid giving this place all five stars!!  We came as a group of four for a quick lunch break. The line was backed up to the door but it went really fast. They are super quick about taking your order, getting your money, and getting your food to you. I had the pulled pork plate with two servings of greens and I LOVED it!  I am sad that I'm only here for another week, but I'm considering eating here everyday next week. It was that good and only $7!  The place was clean and what you'd expect for the little hole in the wall BBQ joint that it is. But go here. Do it asap because it's delicious and cheap. You won't be disappointed."
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,"I flew into town from Las Vegas for business and being Labor Day most every place in town was shut.  I found this gem on Yelp and was blown away by how good it was.  Normally I don't pay too much attention to the price of meals while on the road, but I got an incredible lunch for $6.25.  INCREDIBLE BBQ!!!!"
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,"This is probably the best barbecue I've ever had. The pork is so juice, they butter their buns, and their potato salad takes me back to my grandmothers house on sundays. I wish I lived here so that I could have this every day. If you're stopping by or live near by, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND. The delicious aroma of barbecue hits your nose right when you walk in so be prepared to want to order everything! Super friendly staff and quick service!"
Fatman’s Smokehouse BBQ,5,"Great lunch!  Ribs were awesome!  Mac and Cheese was great!  Tea is just sweet enough.  Banana pudding was outstanding!  Stew was tremendous!  Fast, cheap!  AWESOME!!!"
Montgomery Stockyards,5,"Came here with the bf because he was raving about this place. When we drove up and I saw it, I looked at Him puzzled. It looks like am elementary school! Well, let's get to this review:Atmosphere: You will see cowboys walking in and out of this place. It's very casual and can get crowded at lunch. If you decide to sit in and there's more than 2 of you, I'd call first. Cattle is sold on the premises, so if you've never seen a bidding, catch a glimpse. It's pretty interesting!Customer service: the staff is really nice! Typical southern hospitality type service. I felt very comfortable asking for what I needed and making my order. Food: 5 out of 5! That score is mostly right here! I don't typically eat a full burger, but the plain cheeseburger was deeelish! Very tender. The fries are meh. There is a delectable pie called hmmm, it's in the picture that I posted, and you MUST try it. Your sweet tooth will thank you. It's very sweet though, so be aware. Would I recommend? Absolutely!Will I be back? Definitely. Their food is scrumptious!"
Montgomery Stockyards,5,"Outstanding diner attached to the stock yards.  Enjoyed the ""Dam burger.""  A hamburger served between two slices of ribeye steak,  surrounded by a slice of American and Swiss cheese.  The bread appeared to be Texas toast.  Brilliant and so very satisfying.  Sweet tea seemed to be the beverage of choice...buttermilk pie was the preferred desert.  Very warm and cheerful service....typical of Alabama."
Montgomery Stockyards,5,"Awesome little diner, a true local gem"
Southern Comfort,5,"Traveling south and saw this tiny place was near the hotel. Just beyond the power station so slow up because it is a small building but with BIG taste. Lots of menu choices and dry rubbed ribs were our choice. Not the skinny ribs I've eaten before, these were meaty with so much flavor we never even tried the sauce. Plenty of sides to choose from, about half of them are true southern fare. Open friendly atmosphere with some true southern comfort food. Just simply YUMMY!"
Southern Comfort,4,"This is my second visit. Both visits are outstanding!  The homemade chicken tenders are incredible. So was the WELL flavored collard greens. Mac-n-cheese was quite good. My server, Angel was awesome and has a fun personality. All their staff is attentive. Their pulled pork sandwich should labeled ""the ball and mitt"".  The pork resembles the size of a softball ""sandwiched between the buns resembling a baseball mitt. ALOT of pork.Good food!!!"
Southern Comfort,4,"On a quick trip back to Montgomery for work, I stopped in about 50 minutes before closing to grab some good southern BBQ after a day of flying and Southern Comfort's ratings couldn't be ignored. It was nearly empty so I was seated immediately and help was quick. I got the Memphis style ribs (my go-to when comparing BBQ places) with a couple sides and wrapped up with the Caramel Apple cake.The ribs unfortunately were not fall-off-the-bone and actually had a pretty substantial sinew going through them, so it was even tough to cut each bone off. The rub and rib meat was tasty, but I can't say it was the best I've had. The sides were standard fare but the highlight of the meal was the cake. Pretty moist and delicious.I'm sad cuz this was a ""drive by"" (which I see is where most of the reviews come from) so it's difficult to see if this was a one-off or standard, close-to-closing fare."
Southern Comfort,4,"We came here because of the wonderful reviews. It was exactly what we pictured. The food saves this place immensely. Whatever their cooks are doing in the kitchen, it's working. We loved all of our food. The BBQ Pulled Pork Cuban was an extra favorite.Unfortunately, we would have given 5 stars except for the service. Our waitress looked bored. She was willing to tell us that everything on the menu is good and had some recommendations, but we had to ask. We had to ask for drink refills. We preemptively went to the counter to pay, so we didn't have to ask for the check. However, it was really only her that seemed like she absolutely did not want to be there. Most of the staff was friendly.Overall, it's a great stop right off the highway. Totally worth it to sit down to eat rather than pull through a drive-thru."
Southern Comfort,4,"Found this little unpretentious place by accident. It looks scary from the outside, but trust me, it is worth stopping in. My husband and I are taking a road trip through the southeast and this was our first experience  with true southern food. The collard greens, catfish and corn bread were delicious . I had the smoked ribs, sweet style, and fried green tomatoes. The ribs were dry rubbed, moist, and tasty. No sauce needed (although it's there at the table if you need it.)The green tomatoes were too hot to eat for a few mi utes, and once they cooled down a bit you could really taste the tart snap.  They were so good!Dessert? Oh yes! Key lime pie and banana pudding served in mini Mason jars. Adorable and very good.  The key lime pie wasn't too sweet at all. In fact, it's probably the only other tart key lime pie I've ever hadThe server was hassled and busy but she made sure we weren't ignored, so I can get past the fact that she was short and unsmiling. All in all, a great meal at a great price."
Southern Comfort,5,"Leaving the airport and headed south, I wanted something reasonable and filling. Southern Comfort delivered. Their pulled pork is lean and delicious. It smells like its freshly smoke (the right way). The sauces are made in house and carry the right flavors. I had a cup of the Brunswick Stew. Next it'll be a bowl and my meal. That stuff is delicious! Worth the stop. The banana pudding was pretty tasty and came in a mini mason jar. It's definitely homemade and full of puddingy vanilla wafers- just like I like it! Next time I'd skip the slaw- just not the flavor I like."
Southern Comfort,1,"Entirely disappointing!  My friend and I ordered ribs baked beans and okra.  The okra was great but that is where it stopped. First the ribs. So tough I had to use a knife to cut them.  Chewed some meat, continued to chew and chew some more.  No flavor at all. The BBQ beans tasted like plum beans mixed with water and ketchup with chucks of stewed out of the can tomatoes.  I do not know how this place was reviewed so highly, I can get better ribs at chains like chili's."
Southern Comfort,5,This place was delicious!!! We stopped in after visiting the Safari and WOW! Everything was outstanding! And our  waitress Angel was super friendly and helpful! I had the smoked chicken plate and it was so good! We also had a few at the table with Hamburger steak that licked their plates clean too! And make sure you get a Key Lime Pie in a jar dessert!! To die for!!!
Southern Comfort,5,They never disappoint!! Yummy comfort food seasoned to perfection!!The meatloaf tasted like grandma made it! Chicken fried chicken the best we've ever had!
Southern Comfort,4,Stopped at this restaurant on the way to Atlanta. It's in a great spot. It's right off highway I-65 but it feels out of the way. The restaurant was empty when we arrived but quickly filled up with other travelers. The food was delicious southern comfort food. I highly recommend it if you are passing by. We got to have a sit down meal without losing too much time. Wasn't too expensive either. Service was pretty quick too. Not fast food but not slow food either!
Southern Comfort,5,"Had lunch here recently with my spouse. I had the pulled pork plate with Mac and cheese and fried green tomatoes. It also included white loaf bread. My spouse had a Cobb salad with grilled chicken.The location is very close the the highway 65 access in Hope Hull Alabama. This was the first time eating at this location.Service was excellent. It was 1 pm and they were busy but the waitresses were very good. The location was very clean, including the bath room. The score on the restaurant inspection was 98. Always a good sign. The food was excellent. The pulled pork was perfect. Not greasy. Large serving with two types of sauce on the table. One tomato based and one vinegar based. The fried green tomatoes were good. It had a panko crust. The Mac and cheese was creamy and very cheesy.The salad was very fresh, very large with the grilled chicken cooked perfectly. My wife was very pleased. A great place to eat."
Southern Comfort,4,"We stopped by here during a road trip. There were some good reviews about smoked wings and I really wanted some good wings so we ordered those as appetizers.  12 wings for $11. The wings were delicious. You could taste the smoked flavor and the BBQ sauce was all throughout the flavoring. It wasn't like some places where they cook the wings, dip in sauce and send them out. I highly recommend the wings. I also prefer wings on the well done side and these hit the mark. They were ""meaty"" tasting at all. For entrees I had the chicken fried chicken and hubby had the pulled pork Cuban. My sides were Mac and cheese and gumbo. Hubby had collard greens and fries. My chicken fried chicken was cooked perfectly and the white gravy was good. Chicken fried chicken portion was high. The Mac and cheese was okay. It was super cheesy but not really seasoned. I mean it was good but not like grandma's cooking good. Hubby liked the gumbo (okra based) and greens. No complaints there. He said his Cuban sandwich was good and the flavors meshed well. Our fries came out a lot later than the food but they were hot and fresh and tasted okay. Waitress was nice and conversational. The only reason I'm deducting a star is due to cleanliness. It was trash everywhere all over the floor and tons of tables that weren't bussed. They weren't even busy. Employees were standing around talking or folding napkins. I mean it was a lot of trash on the floor. It really detracted from the decor. The other thing was it was sooooo humid inside. Every time someone came in and left a nice breeze came through but other than that it was hot as heck. I'm a normally cold person and I had to use my menu to fan. It was no circulation because of that either. Super humid. All in all I would definitely return again if I was in the area. It was close to the highway too so not far out of the way."
Southern Comfort,4,"Found this place on a strong recommendation, 15 minutes outside of Montgomery, AL. It's a small place, modest decorating, and very quiet inside. The hostesses are friendly and moved some tables around to accommodate our party of 5. The menu has a nice range of options; I ordered a two piece fried chicken, collard greens, black eyed peas, and an extra side of mac n' cheese! Our waitress, Ginger, even let me be picky and request two thigh pieces! The dish came with some great cornbread, the chicken was cooked fresh and flaky, but needed some more seasoning. The collard greens were perfect. The black eyed peas were a nice consistency, but like the chicken, needed some more flavor. We also ordered some desserts to-go: banana pudding in a jar, key lime pie in a jar, and a chocolate reese's cake. The desserts were super yummy; the key lime pie was my favorite. If I ever find myself back in Montgomery, I would definitely come back to this place!"
Southern Comfort,4,"OH my goodness, what a wonderful restaurant. Passing through for a few days and I am determined to go thru the entire menu. The meatloaf special was flavorful, moist and perfectly cooked. I can't wait to try the fried chicken it looked wonderful I managed to try the fried chicken too. Hot, crispy and juicy. The BBLT was fine, as expected"
Southern Comfort,5,"Absolutely delicious! I chose this place because it's close to the I85/I65 intersection. Met friends from Birmingham there. Had a lovely reunion. Angel was such an enjoyable, personable server. Love love love"
Southern Comfort,4,"Not much to see from the outside but the inside is nice and spacious and very clean.  The help is extremely friendly and the service is quick.  We ordered a pull pork sandwich and bbq chicken.  The sandwich had enough meat on it to feed 2 and it was lightly covered with bbq sauce.  The have 2 types of saucen a memphis style sweet saucesn and a Carolina mustard and vinegar sauce, both of which were tasty.  The southern fried chicken was excellent.  The batter was outstanding and the meat was very hot but little or no grease.  Ordered a side of fries and they came out piping hot and were still hot when the chicken was gone.  This will be one of my stops whenever in the area."
Southern Comfort,5,"Awesome place with great service. Everything here is excellent. Friendly staff who took the time to explain local favorites.  Trish was excellent and seemed to know her way around the menu quite well. We tried the pulled pork sandwich, bbs pork cuban & fried shrimp platter. OUTSTANDING in all categories. For dessert we tried the key lime pie and Reese P-butter cake. Both were awesome. I can't say we visit this part of the country often, but if we do come through again, we will make a point to stop in. Nice job Southern Comfort and shout out to Trish! You won't find this place unless you know about it or look it up. It's hidden off the main road."
Southern Comfort,5,Fantastic food. The owner and the staff are very nice. Chicken is some of the best I've ever had. The collard greens are fresh and homemade. The fried green tomatoes are amazing with a panko crust. Fried catfish was incredible and the deserts are off the hook
Southern Comfort,4,"Went on a weekday mid afternoon and had the place to ourselvesCorn nuggets, fresh and just as you would hope for-  hot, greasy ( in a good way) sweet and salty, with a side of ranch ( unnecessary)Smoked wings BBQ style were a bit over cooked and over seasoned/salty Ribs were flavorful  dry rub, black eyed peas and greens cooked and seasoned perfectly!Solid place to grab a bite in an otherwise barren landscape!Manager was friendly and helpful ( actually made us aware of road closure on I-65 the way we were headed) so we re- routed earlier than most travelers and had a pleasant drive through the country until we re-joined.I-65."
Southern Comfort,5,"Excellent!We were staying at the Holiday inn and went to eat for supper.    The place is located down an unexpected side road that isn't very well lit. (The road connects to the far side of holiday inn parking lot but the access is blocked)Worth the very short drive.The kids hamburger was huge and yummy. It was not the typically dried out little kid patty.  This was a good burger that I could have eaten.  The husband got a country fried steak that he swears is the best he has ever eaten.  My oldest son and I got the vegetable plate.  We had big portions of vegetables ... fried okra, baked beans, green beans, fried green tomatoes and huge cornbread muffins. All the food was hot and delicious.  The staff was great as well.  All the staff was courteous , charming, and professional.   Our drinks were never empty.Great place. We will return."
Filet & Vine,5,Great place! I used to come here all the time when I attended ASU! They have a great breakfast. Came here for lunch and it was great. They make great sandwiches and have a lovely salad bar. They also have a hot bar with lots of southern staples.
Filet & Vine,1,"The food here was amaaaaazing and I enjoyed everything on my plate.Now let's talk service.  THIS PLACE had the kind of service I was expecting coming to ""the south."" Our group had been fortunate enough to be proven wrong for most of our trip. Until we ended up here.  Myself, two other Black folks and another PoC member of our party were the only PoC eating there the day we went. So I guess you could say it came as no surprise to me that after we ordered, the white woman who was politely checking in with every table seemed to skip over us MULTIPLE times. I'm pretty sure that if it wasn't the kind of place where you get your food cafeteria-style, we would have never been served.To solidify our ""suspicions of racism,"" we had the wonderful opportunity of watching Jeff Sessions walk into the restaurant and be treated like a King. It gave me a much better understanding of the ""preferred clientele"" here.All in all, if you're looking for some good food with a healthy dose of racism, check this place out. But you can most likely find some better, not racist, soul/southern food in the area."
Filet & Vine,4,"I was in this area earlier today after leaving an interview and I really wanted to eat some healthier options. So I came across this place searching on yelp and decided to try it out.  They have so many options to choose from! They have burgers, philly cheese steaks, soup and salad bar and aa hot bar with meat snd 3 options! This place also sells bottled wine, beers and a few small grocery items.I ordered the Chicken Piccata with marinara sauce, broccoli with cheese snd squash casserole.  Overall my meal wasn't bad, it was just ok.  I was so hungry I ate every bit of my food, lol.  I'm trying to stick to a low carb diet, but I will definitely try something with more carbs next time!!A little noisy by the counter where people are ordering food, but in small sit down area was a little quieter."
Filet & Vine,4,"We were in Montgomery for a training at the Hospital, and needed a close/quick place to eat. Most folks were going  to fast food restaurants, but a colleague consulted a friend from the area who suggested Filet and Vine! We arrived at the peak of lunchtime, thankfully found a close parking spot, and wandered in. This place was hugeeee!!! And the hot bar options were amazing with so many options! The salad bar (from what I saw) was also quite extensive. These sorts of places are great for large groups, to ensure everyone can find something to eat. My steak was excellent, as was the squash casserole. I got a piece of Reese's cake for dessert, but couldn't hardly eat it because it was so rich, and I was so fill from the meal! I've bookmarked this place in case I'm ever back in Montgomery.... and so should you!"
Filet & Vine,5,Holy crap. The beer selection!! So massive and great and mainly local brews... like omg I wanted to try all their beers!! Then the food line. Some yummy looking good ole home cooking southern foods. Ok so the meatloaf. Holy smack licking tasting delicious yummy moist and just AAAAHHHMAZING! Like so good I went back a few times for it again and again. The fried chicken was a little underwhelming but so good and the meatloaf just dominated it! Then the mashed potatoes and cheesy potatoes were so good too. But I am such a sucker for Mac and cheese that it was for sure the best side. Wrap that up with some sweet potato casserole and it makes for an amazing great meal!
Filet & Vine,4,"Great wine selection with price points under $20 and over $100 per bottle.  Knowledgable staff who are willing to find what you're after.  Co-located with a deli with pre-pared and made to order foods, fresh and frozen.  If it's imported beer you're after, they have that too.  Stop by and check it out."
Filet & Vine,3,"I came here at lunchtime to shop for beer to compliment a meal I was making later that evening. Yes, I came here at lunch, but not for lunch. Let that be a warning to anyone who would be in my situation. I knew this place was popular for lunch, but unfortunately the lunch set-up limits one's ability to shop for beer or wine, which is pretty annoying. First, only part of the beer selection was accessible as an entire aisle of beer shelving was also lined with tables of people eating their lunch, so I wasn't really able to see what was on those shelves without disturbing people, which I wasn't prepared to do. The second lunchtime disruption is to check out, you have to stand in the lunch line, as that's the only check-out line that's open. I understand they need to dedicate resources to handle the lunch rush, so I'm only saying this as a warning to other would-be beer shoppers. Come either before or after the lunch rush. Since I was in line anyway, I did get some mac and cheese and cornbread. The mac and cheese was delicious. The cornbread was, too, but a bit dry if I'm honest. Still, I'd get it again. Also, while the selection is massive for the area, a lot of is redundant with the local stores. Lots of local beer selections, which most local stores carry (with a few exceptions). And the import selection (specifically the Belgian and English beers), really only hit the commonly known stuff and leave little room for exploration of new stuff from elsewhere. So, while their website advertises ""over 750 beers"", and I have trouble believing that number, the selection itself could be a bit broader. There's something for everyone, but not much depth. I'll be back to get the full experience, so consider this a narrow-view and caveated three stars, because the full-service business is definitely not full-service during the lunch rush."
Filet & Vine,4,You have to give this place a try. The food is good and fresh. My work uses it for meetings with clients and the management has also gone out of their way  to reserve an area for our private party. I would definitely put this place on the must tries in Montgomery. The only issues is that parking can be limited and lunch time is very busy like most places.
Filet & Vine,5,"Filet and Vine is a diamond in the rough!  I've been here numerous times this summer and I'll surely miss it as I venture my way back home to Colorado.  Filet and Vine is essentially a pretty awesome deli/bakery/liquor store/winery/southern buffet. Yes, all of those things in one.More often then not I end up ordering the bahn mi because let's be honest, it's freakin amazing. Essentially it's a grilled pork sandwich with a delicious slaw, pickle, and aoli that bring it all together. The ingredients are like a party in your mouth. It's so good I've found myself dreaming about it. I've also tried the Ruben which was good but it definitely wasn't the bahn mi. While you wait for your food your sure to be mesmerized by the assortment of beers, wines, and baked goods. I never got around to trying out the hot line but it features tasty looking southern favorites like fried chicken, cat fish, ribs, mac, cobblers, potatoes, etc. You should note that they usually close at 7 pm and they are closed on Sunday's. If you find yourself in the area and your looking for a delicious bite to eat, stop by, JUST DO IT!"
Filet & Vine,5,"Absolutely amazing. The hot bar, sandwiches and soup and salad bar option provide a variety of choices for all tastes. They now open at 10 but the hot bar isn't open until 11. Included is a uniques neighborhood grocery store as well as a butcher ship and a wine bar/ store. This is a must for lunch if you are driving through Montgomery."
Filet & Vine,5,"We love coming to Filet & Vine! We're normally busy during the week so we typically come for lunch on Saturdays. The hot bar selection is fantastic and I've never got something that didn't taste great. Some of our favorite things to get are the fried fish, new potatoes, turnip green, mac n cheese, and the jalapeño cornbread. You really can't go wrong with any of the other options, though. My only complaint is that sometimes you might get the short end of the stick and be given a small piece of meat because it's what's left on the hot bar if they haven't refilled it yet."
Filet & Vine,5,Best game in town for food. Breakfast is second to none (saturdays only for now). Quick and easy. With a super nice staff.
Filet & Vine,3,"I was in town visiting and was craving some good 'ole southern food so turned to Yelp! for inspiration and ended up at Filet & Vine. I tried the hot bar and I opted for fried chicken, Mac n cheese, cheesy broccoli, and corn bread. I found the food to be decent, but nothing overly great...the chicken was a little dry, the corn bread was flavorless, the Mac n cheese was really good, and the broccoli again was good not great. For the $9 I paid it was a fine enough meal but didn't leave me wanting to come back"
Filet & Vine,4,"This is a great meat and three restaurant. You pick-up your food from a cafeteria-style line that moves very fast, sometimes with the employees pushing you to make decisions too quickly. On my most recent visit, I got a boneless fried chicken breast, mac and cheese, green beans, and cornbread. The Mac and cheese and cornbread were excellent, but the green beans weren't great. The chicken was moist and tasty but they've definitely changed their provider of chickens in the past few years and the serving size was smaller. The restaurant also has a wine and beer shop with a wide-ranging selection. My major complaint about this place is the price. It's an expensive lunch option, especially for Alabama."
Filet & Vine,4,A great little market and diner.  Fast food counter inside with good selection of local specialties.  I liked the fried chicken and BBQ sandwich.  Great mac and cheese too.  Terrific selection of wines and sodas.
Filet & Vine,4,"Interestingly eclectic space which combines a smallNeighborhood market, butcher shop, a wine store, and a deli  with an extensive hot food bar full of yummy southern comfort foods, delicious broad spectrum of made to order sandwiches including a Cuban and Banh Mi. They also have a friendly, helpful staff. We had Banh Mi (not exactly like I have had before, but very tasty) served with some yummy chips and we topped it off with a slice of Italian cake which was a genuine slice of heaven. There are plenty of tables available and real cutlery so you don't have to fumble w/plastic junk. Worth the quick trip From downtown."
Filet & Vine,5,Great lunch spot . I would recommend this to anyone . Great variety of food . Everything was as advertised. I will make sure I hit this place again if I'm every back in Montgomery.
Filet & Vine,5,"If you have one day to eat out in Montgomery and you want pizza, I'd recommend Pies & Pints. If you want anything else at all, this is where you need to eat. I don't know how they do it, but somehow they pull off a delicious assortment of steaks, chicken, fish, pork chops, and side dishes to include amazing corn on the cob, sweet potato casserole, mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, and a lot of others. All of it-every single dish-is amazing. And you'll pay about $13-$16 for a meat and two sides. I'm not done! There's also the ""& Vine"" part. A nice selection of wine, a great selection of local and non-local craft beers, and a small bar where you can either sit and drink or buy your alcohol to go. Only one downside: parking. It gets busy at lunch and there are precious few spots, so either get there before noon or late PM. There are other spots nearby but you might have to walk a way. Small price to pay for what you get here. Fast service, awesome food, great beer and wine. Don't leave Montgomery without stopping here!"
Filet & Vine,5,Favorite place to grab a bottle of wine and have lunch. The family that runs Filet & Vine really knows how to treat people. The food is always great and I always get tons of help picking out beer & wine. Saturday they have ribs!!
Filet & Vine,5,Great hole in the wall joint for some local cooking. Highly recommend! Make sure to get the fresh made sandwiches.
Dreamland BBQ,5,"So first off: the food itself is about the best BBQ you'll get in Alabama. Yes, the ribs are all they're cracked up to me, the sides fantastic, but the sausage is the sleeper hit you need to make sure you try. Service is fast and friendly and always goes the extra mile (like giving me a to-go Diet Coke after I finished my meal without me even asking). Interestingly enough, I first went here years ago as a kid and have wondered in the last 18 years what the name of that phenomenal rib place was, only to happen upon it again by chance while in town in business in Montgomery.Finally, I need to add this: perhaps basking in the afterglow of that meal, I left my debit card there by mistake, only realizing after I was well over an hour on the road. I had an appointment and could not double back. Not only did they offer to mail me the card, they overnighted it to my next destination on my trip for work. The owners and patrons of Dreamland are lucky to have such incredible and thoughtful staff. Sometimes you stumble upon restaurants you're able to remember for 18 years like I did because of their standout food; sometimes you remember them because they invoke some nostalgia; others have amazing service. Dreamland stands out by having all 3. You need to check it out when you're in Montgomery."
Dreamland BBQ,4,"I visited Dreamland a few months ago with a large group from the University of Texas at San Antonio as a part of our Civil Rights and Social Justice Experience. With a group of 50 people, it can be hard to find restaurants large enough  to stretch our legs and discuss the events of the day. Dreamland BBQ gave us an awesome space downstairs to dine and bond as a group. I didn't see an elevator, so I am not sure how accessible this space is to all patrons. The bathrooms upstairs were spacious and clean. We had waitstaff with us all night to make sure the space was clean and help us with any need we had.As for the food, Dreamland provided us with a buffet of pulled chicken and pork, buns, potato salad, baked beans and banana bread pudding. It was one of the best meals of our trip! The pulled pork was flavorful and juicy and the beans had a great BBQ flavorful that brought the whole meal together. My only negative was the BBQ sauce itself. To me the sauce was pretty thin/watery and had a vinegary taste to it. I prefer a less vinegar based sauce. The banana bread pudding was the star of the meal. It was sweet, but the bread and bananas weren't so soggy that it felt like you were eating banana baby food, as can happen with banana puddings gone wrong. Be sure to stop in to Dreamland BBQ next time you're in town!"
Dreamland BBQ,2,"So this place is overhyped for nothing in my opinion. The biggest flaw in this place is that I have never been to a BBQ place that does not serve brisket!!  Crazy to think they don't have it there as it is probably the second most common item behind ribs! We came in with a large group and had reservations so we were seated fairly quickly. We ordered our food and when I saw the menu, I was so dissappointed. I was curious as to what their BBQ taste like, and so I ordered the sampler plattter with a combination of many other meats as well. All of the food was ""meh"" and I definitely have experienced MUCH MUCH better BBQ at many other places so I am not sure why this place is rated so highly. I do recommend the banana pudding, but you can get banana pudding in a lot of places."
Dreamland BBQ,5,"Ended up in Montgomery and wanted to support a local business. Very glad we did too! Great service and great barbecue. There are televisions all around so you will definitely be entertained if you do not care for your present company. I had the sausage and with baked beans and potato salad. The ribs were amazing! They fell right off the bone and the sauce was delectable. Sausage was great, baked beans were so good, and the potato salad was definitely up there. Overall I am very glad I was able to try this place out and support a local business."
Dreamland BBQ,5,"Dreamland BBQ was the last place I ate during my vacation to Montgomery, and I went home with a smile on my face and a full belly. From the smoked sausage to the pulled pork, from the mac & cheese to the fried okra, everything was cooked to perfection, seasoned very well, and accompanied by such an amazing barbecue sauce. Of course, I had to pair my meal with a tall glass (okay, two glasses) of sweet tea, and when I saw that they had banana pudding on the menu, you know I had to indulge. I probably could have ordered and eaten two helpings, but sometimes you have to stop when you're ahead. Dreamland truly is where bbq dreams come to life!"
Dreamland BBQ,3,This was a real treat in downtown Montgomery. I was directed to Dreamland from some locals when I inquired where the locals dine. Close to The Montgomery Biscuits Stadium and downtown area. They have their own craft beer which was pretty good.It went well with my BBQ sandwich. The bbq base is a vinegar based and had a great flavor . Reasonably priced and generous on the meat. I had never had dill pickles on BBQ pulled pork before but will add it from now on! Yummy!
Dreamland BBQ,5,"I was in Montgomery visiting the Legacy Museum and Memorial and asked where I could find good food. Hands down? Dreamland came up over and over. We went, we partook and we're delighted. Everything was great, we'll seasoned but not salty. Definitely a go to when I'm in the area again."
Dreamland BBQ,4,"Good BBQ spot located in the heart of downtown Montgomery.  We were in town to visit the Legacy Museum and our hotel was around the corner from Dreamland.  I've been seeing the signs when passing through Tuscaloosa over many years, but had never taken the opportunity to stop.  We dropped our bags and walked over with our party of 4.  Snagged a table without waiting despite having no reservation.  We tried most of the meats.  The ultimate BBQ plate comes with 3 meats (had ribs, chicken, and sausage)  and that was just my entree.  Each meat was good, but surprisingly my least favorite was the ribs.  They were large and meaty, but I prefer a bit more tenderness and ""fall off of the bone"" meat.  Both the sausage and chicken were outstanding.  My sides were the creamy cole slaw, and the crisp fried okra.  Lasherrie , our server, was excellent.  Of note, the bar only serves beer and wine.  Good spot to visit when in the area."
Dreamland BBQ,4,"Its bbq  James, just not as we know it.Montgomery Alabama style bbq, Dreamland is a small regional chain.They're brewing beer as well, some crafty types, not our thing.We were taking a break from FRIED, so bbq meat was fine.Sauce of the vinegary variety. Dip as u munch away. Sides are weaker than the meat, nothing to write home about, but decent quality.We tried baked beans / side salad, avoided cheesy stuff with a bit of effort . Portions ok, not HUGE, not too small, overall a 3 1/2 $tar experience rounded up.Ribs were best of the 3 'meats' we sampled, chicken wing / breast next &  least of all the beef rib tip, not poor, not inspirational either. Lacked that nice charred rib end taste, these were lame, soft, meh.Better than most chains all things considered.Not a destination restaurant, but handy location near the baseball ground and museum district on Jefferson St.Super helpful and friendly staff. Parking easy peasy on a meter after hours = no pay.Comfortable spacious earns a qualified recommendation with 3 1/2 rounded up to 4 on the yelpmeter"
Dreamland BBQ,4,The ribs were good And tender just wish it was more. The chicken was chopped very small and kind of dry. The sausage was ok. We were disappointed in the sides. The baked beans seemed like they came out of a can and the Mac and cheese wasn't any better. The service was good
Dreamland BBQ,4,"Perfect lunch spot after a few of the downtown Montgomery museums. It was lunchtime and crowded, but plenty of space so we didn't wait for a seat. I had the loaded baked potato with BBQ pork and it was very good. My boyfriend had the three meat trio plate: ribs, chicken and pork. He really enjoyed the ribs!We had to finish off with dessert: a banana pudding and a chocolate dream. Both were very good! Our waitress, Cindy, was GREAT. Made some honest recommendations and was very helpful as we ordered. Her personality was welcoming and made us feel like we were right at home. This was closer to a 4.5 in my opinion. The food was good, but not to die for which is a 5 in my books. We will definitely return the next time we are in Montgomery."
Dreamland BBQ,4,"Great Southern BBQ! I visited on a Sunday evening, about 5pm. It was crowded, but not unmanageable. I was alone, so I went right to the bar and was immediately welcomed by a friendly bartender. I ordered the 3 meat plate with chicken, sausage and ribs. All very good. This could have easily been a 5 star review, but they were out of several local draught beers. Also, the hostess wasn't at all friendly or welcoming. The food is good, though, as is the convenient location."
Dreamland BBQ,5,"Loved the atmosphere and the music. I had the rib tips on top of the baked potato. Very good, however I was expecting rib tips with the bone in, but it seemed like rib pieces. I'm a rib tip connoisseur, so I was a little bit disappointed in that. I had the banana pudding for dessert and it was delicious. My husband enjoyed the flight of beers. I was told by 5 different locals that Dreamland is the best BBQ in Montgomery. UPDATE: 12/31/2018 - I came back just to see if they could get me some rib tips some how. Our waitress (Erma) came through! These aren't even on the menu. She went back and asked the cook (Noe) to make them for me. The customer service was impeccable! She even got me some to take home! (I paid for) I am THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED! We spoke about her employment and she just raved about Dreamland and how she loves working here. It shows! Thank you so much! We WILL be back!"
Dreamland BBQ,3,"Reasonably priced, decent BBQ.  I had the chopped pork and the rib tips and I couldn't tell which was which.  They only offered once sauce which had a nice tang, but it wasn't exceptional.   The Mac and cheese was unremarkable but the okra was good.  This is. Good option if you need a BBQ fix, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."
Dreamland BBQ,4,"Always a good time at dreamland.  The food is good and the people that work there are great.  Per usual, they were busy but able to get us in pretty quickly to a shared table.  I really like their new location, it is open and lighter everywhere.  The meats are great.  The only thing is that I don't LOVE the BBQ sauce.  It is fine, but I would like another option.  But again, everything else makes up for it and overall it is always good and tasty."
Dreamland BBQ,3,"This place was okay but nothing amazing.My ribs were hard to eat.The burger seemed well done. This place seemed to be banking off their huge bar rather than bringing in the business with quality food.There was also a table issue, the people up front could not figure out how to manage the few people waiting. When they fondly sat us we were in a section of four empty booths... not sure why they weren't being used they were connected to the main dining room. They lost a party of seven while we waited which was clearly an organization failure.I would definitely recommend some additional host training.Overall probably a fun bar"
Dreamland BBQ,4,Great location and friendly staff.  It's next to the ballpark near the river.  The service was prompt and attentive to my needs.  I ordered the ribs.  Great flavor and the meat was moist.  Each rib leaves you wanting another rib.  The sides are average.  Great place to watch a game.  Definitely can accommodate large groups.  Worth eating here if you are in the area.
Dreamland BBQ,4,"Ordered the two meat and two sides. The chicken was delicious as usual absolutely no complaints. The ribs on the other hand was dry and just ok, as everyone knows you can't have dry pork it's a nonstarter. My friend had the pulled pork and sausage, both were good. Mac n cheese and potato salad were tasty."
Dreamland BBQ,4,Good food!!! Wasnt busy took awhile for food. But it was good just service could improve alittle!! Didn't get our appetizer . Will give it a try again
Dreamland BBQ,5,"By far the best place to eat in Montgomery for barbecue. The ribs are amazing as is the fried okra. Tried a bunch of different things from the menu and haven't had anything bad yet... But those ribs! Service is friendly and it's a nice atmosphere. If you're not sure what to get, get the ultimate platter. It's three meats and two sides. Can't go wrong."
Cahawba House,5,"An AMAZING breakfast spot right in downtown Montgomery. This place serves both breakfast and lunch but both times I have been here it was for breakfast. This is a southern style restaurant serving up simple breakfast and lunch options. Both times I went here I got the build your own breakfast plate with eggs, bacon, a biscuit, and one of their featured jam. First off, the biscuits are absolutely phenomenal! They are fluffy and have just enough salt added for flavor. I tried both the vanilla bourbon and the strawberry basil jams they offer and while both were amazing, I knew I had to buy a jar of the vanilla bourbon. The bacon was super crispy and the eggs were cooked perfectly. Both times coming here I enjoyed sipping the Prevail Union coffee they have out at the self serve station.There is enough tables and chairs to accommodate families and smaller groups but just be aware that it may be busy at certain times. The service is super fast and I only waited for my food a couple of minutes both times after ordering from the counter. Everyone who works here is sweet and really offers that southern hospitality. If you are in Montgomery give this place a visit!"
Cahawba House,4,"Packed for brunch on a Saturday--even though later in the day--attentive, smiling, hipster kids keeping up with orders, and overall good food. Nothing was ground-breaking but overall traditional and authentic Southern cuisine. What really makes this place so beloved I think is the atmosphere--everything from the homey setting in rather small quarters to the happy and helpful staff to the unsweet tea being labeled ""ain't sweet"". It's just all very welcoming and inviting. I had fried chicken, green bean casserole, and mac n' cheese and all was pretty good--not the finest fried chicken ever, but good all the same. There's no doubt there is a lot of heart behind this place and it shows. Certainly a great choice for lunch or any time they're open if in downtown Montgomery."
Cahawba House,5,This is a gem!!! Such a cute spot with amazing food and service. I ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches. Southern biscuit and copy cat. I also got a side of fried chicken which was perfectly moist and crispy. The fries are perfectly cut and season. Now the jam!!!!! The strawberry basil was deliciously everything and the blueberry was amazing!I ordered a couple jams to take back home! Such a good place that we are coming back tomorrow before we leave Alabama. A bonus was we even met a jersey girl at the register. It was just meant to be.
Cahawba House,5,"Woah. The pimento grilled cheese is out of this world. It will make your belly so happy. Everything on the menu sounded so delicious, I wanted to try it all. I settled on that pimento grilled cheese and I'm so happy I did. It's REALLY cheesy y'all. So if you're not a big cheese fan, get out. JK, just order something else. But also, get out of here. They have some sauces that you can add to the side for fry dipping, which I am always a fan of. I chose the mama's sauce and the garlic aioli. Both were great. Definitely make your way here if you're looking for a delicious meal!"
Cahawba House,4,Great breakfast/brunch/lunch spot!This is a great no-frills eatery in downtown Montgomery.  The menu is simple and customisable - and we loved that the breakfast menu items were available all day.  The staff were friendly and the prices were reasonable.  We highly recommend the biscuits and the beignets!
Cahawba House,5,"Amazing biscuits!  Tons of biscuit toppings to create your own delicious breakfast - jellies, honeys, cheese, eggs - what's not to love?"
Cahawba House,4,"Came here for a Sunday brunch with a friend. They weren't too busy when we arrived. The atmosphere is pretty laid back and seems like a breakfast nook. They have local products for sale as well that you can take home. They operate in a fast casual system and the food came out very quickly. One downside was the we were constantly asked if we needed anything else 9-10 times through our meal, which is great in moderation but can become overbearing. On looking at the menu, they have a large variety with both breakfast and lunch options. Everything seems to be ordered separately and you  can add on sides as you please. Everything is reasonably priced. I decided on the Southern Biscuit which came with bacon, pimento cheese, and a fried green tomato on it. It was very tasty and a nice light brunch option. If you're very hungry definitely order a side with your biscuit. Overall a nice, reasonably-priced place to get brunch/lunch in downtown Montgomery."
Cahawba House,4,"12/29/19 Had a lovely brunch earlier today. A young lady greeted me at the door and handed me a menu to choose what I would like. The lady at the cashier was also very helpful.I ordered the meat loaf with a side of mashed potatoes and requested the gravy on the side. Also requested collard greens. And a soft drink. My food was brought to my table exactly as I had requested,when it was ready. It was fresh and delicious. I enjoyed the iced tea as well. Initially I had unsweet tea. For my refill I mixed a little sweet tea with the unsweet tea. That tasted better LOL. Overall this is a lovely Southern Café in the downtown Montgomery district. Prices are reasonable.Highly recommend"
Cahawba House,5,"This little Montgomery gem is fantastic! Hubby and I were on our way to Atlanta and decided to seek out a local place to eat. I ordered the baked chicken with a couple of veggie sides. Hubby got the meatloaf and hand cut fries. Wow, the food was delicious and the service was incredible.We are planning our next trip and making certain that Cahawba is on the itinerary!  The added bonus is that we met a wonderful couple from Montgomery who suggested many awesome places to visit."
Cahawba House,5,"Amazing brunch spot in the heart of downtown Alabama, and for such a reasonable price! The fried green tomato was delicious, and the biscuit was so fluffy and buttery. They also sell a lot of cute local handmade goods, so a good place to pick up a souvenir if you want"
Cahawba House,2,"I ordered 2 lunches from here a few weeks ago, the chicken salad sandwich and a BLGT. We received an excellent amount of food but their chicken salad has a grossly amount of mayo and their fries are best consumed immediately. When they get warm-coldish they get mushy and very greasy."
Cahawba House,5,"I had the delight of dining at Cahawba House when I was in town for an interview.  I was very hungry, and the oxtail special called my name off the menu.  I had never had oxtail before, and let me tell you, CH's oxtail has changed my life.  I am a convert.  Staff was very friendly and prices were reasonable.  You order at the register, take a number, and self seat.  I got the oxtail with rice and gravy and an Arnold Palmer.  Staff bussed a table for me, because the restaurant was fairly crowded.  If I'm ever back in this area, I will definitely be hitting Cahawba House again."
Cahawba House,4,"Though very small, the Cahawba House really packs a punch in terms of breakfast and lunch. We arrived earlier on in the lunch shift but it was already full of important-seeming government people having important-seeming meetings. We didn't get a seat inside, but thankfully the outdoor seating was available and comfortable. We enjoyed our selections (Mac & Cheese + fries for our daughter, Sides/Vegetable plate for me, and a ginormous meatloaf sandwich + fries for my husband. Personally I do not believe that meat belongs in a loaf, but he seemed to really enjoy that thing. No complaints from our very picky kiddo on her food (5 stars for that alone), and my greens, potatoes/gravy, and broccoli casserole were just about the best I've had at any meat & 3 type establishment. If you're in the Montgomery area, swing by the Cahawba House for a great meal!"
Cahawba House,5,"Excellent breakfast. The restaurant is a short walk from the Renaissance Hotel. The biscuits are excellent - served with a variety of flavors - in, on or near the biscuits. The service is helpful and attentive (you order at the register and your food is brought to you - coffee is self-serve). There is also outdoor seating. The only disappointment is that they were out of grits at 9:30 AM on the day we were there."
Cahawba House,5,Best Mac n cheese I've ever eaten (I tasted somemy hubby ordered.) I also loved my Chicken and the Egg Biscuit which is delicious and comes with goat cheese!
Cahawba House,5,"The grilled pimento cheese was amazing! The home fries could have been a little crispier, but that didn't even matter. The grilled pimento cheese sandwich was that good. Plus, this was enough food for 3 meals for me."
Cahawba House,5,"Tucked away in downtown Montgomery, this hidden gem is anything but ordinary.As a girl that has traveled the world sampling cuisine, there is nothing like coming home to the south and eating good southern cooking like my grandma used to make. My husband had spent a few months in the area and while I was there visiting him we decided to give this little eatery a try for breakfast. I must say I didn't know what to expect going in. You look at a menu, you order, then you sit and wait for your food to be brought to you. My husband ordered the breakfast sandwich, and I ordered a biscuit topped with pimento cheese, fries green tomatoes, eggs, and bacon with a side of cheese grits. Y'all. That biscuit not only was amazing, soft, buttery, everything a biscuit should be, but dare I say it was better than my granny's! One should note that it's pretty rare to find anything in the south better than what granny makes, but somehow the Cahawba House did just that. I'll end with if you ever find yourself in Montgomery for any reason and are looking for a good breakfast, Cahawba House is a sure bet."
Cahawba House,5,"I heard about this place and then I forgot about it. I apologize for that because I definitely made a mistake. I was taking pictures downtown this morning and when I got down walking around downtown I yelped for a breakfast spot other than Waffle House and this place popped up. I walked in and was welcomed with a smile and a greeting from the waitress. I created a biscuit sandwich and I must say they have a great selection of jams, jellies, proteins and sub items. I decided to get a biscuit with conecuh sausage, scrambled eggs with cheese and their peach habanero jam. I also had fried green tomatoes and gravy on the side with a coffee. The food was amazing along with the coffee. I loved that jam a lot and the layout and setting of the restaurant was a cool cozy chill vibe. I know I will definitely come back again for either the same or order something different"
Cahawba House,4,"Good biscuits for sure but the jams aren't anything to write home about. We tried six of them and still felt mixed - good but not worth buying/taking home. GREAT, friendly service though. Everyone kept asking how we were doing, what we liked, etc."
Cahawba House,5,"If there were 6 Stars....I went today and the weather was perfect to eat outside which is a great option!  The staff can't be any nicer!!Today I ordered the purple hull peas, Mac and Cheese, Collards and Fried Green Tomatoes.  It was ambitious knowing their portion sizes...I left with enough for round two for lunch tomorrow.  Everything was incredible.  The FGTs and Collards were best I have had, maybe ever, and not exaggerating.  This place is a hidden gem with a great reputation in town and it is well-earned."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,5,"This is the real deal. So, for context you must understand a few things first. Hyundai has a major plant in Montgomery so there is a sizable Korean population here--not just Korean-Americans but Koreans straight from South Korea. Thus, a high demand for authentic Korean food. Secondly, I cook a lot of Korean food at home: I am fluent in Korean and constantly getting new recipes from Naver blogs and elsewhere. Most of what I cook comes from reputable sources in South Korea, so I'm up on what people are cooking there and trends in restaurants. This place measures up: from the call buttons to summon a waitress to bringing out the tongs and shears for galbi-tang, this is how it's done in South Korea. By taste, slightly more fish sauce taste in some things here, but not overly salty. And you can taste the subtle flavor of sesame oil--which is highly prized and produced with many varied flavor profiles in Korea. Pretty sure they used one brand/variety for one banchan and another for another--because the different flavors complimented the dishes in question better. That's how on they are here. In South Korea, people fuss over sesame oil worse than the French over wine or Italians over olive oil. My soup and all my banchan were incredible, especially some of the banchan. The gosari namul and kkakdugi especially stood out as exceptional. Seriously, there was really nothing I could even consider improving about this whole experience. If you like Korean food and you're in or around Montgomery, you really have to try this place."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this place and I came here quite a few times while I was in Montgomery for a couple months and I brought friends each time and they also enjoyed it a lot as well. To start, this place has tofu soup, AKA soon do boo. That was already a win for me because that is probably my favorite korean food. In addition, they have a tofu soup and you can add noodles to them in a larger bowl. I love ramen noodles, so I had ramen in my tofu soup. I did not expect to have ramen or good korean food in Montgomery, but this place was able to check off both. They also have your typical korean BBQ, bulgogi, galbi, etc. Everyone here was having a blast cooking their food on the grills. There was one night that we did family style and ordered a variety of food. This place was the first time I've ever seen them use a gas grill to cook bulgogi in the center and have noodle soup on the side ring like a donut. It was pretty good and everyone was satisfied with the tastes of everything. The side dishes were also really good too. The first couple times, they had water crest side dish, but the times after they did not have it anymore or was out for the day. I was really sad about that. But overall here, it was a great experience."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,3,"Stopped by here when we had a short stop in Montgomery. Now to be fair, there were only two korean places in this city and we chose the one with the good reviews.It was decent. Being that I live so close to Koreatown in Los Angeles, my expectation are high!The beef short ribs to me were lacking in flavor but still decent.The tofu soup was disappointing. It was way to salty for my tasty. We also got the pork cutlets which again were lacking in flavor though the sauce we were given was good. Service was great, no line and plentiful parking. The prices were ok. Maybe a bit too much for the amount that we got."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,5,"I have been to this restaurant so many times, and I have never been disappointed with their food. The staffs here are very enthusiastic and thoughtful. Moreover, they are very friendly and always happy to serve me. So now, whenever I come here, they remember exactly what I like to eat or what I usually ordered. Really love this place."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,4,"Solid Asian restaurants are hard to find in Montgomery, AL...so I've been eyeing So Gong Dong when I spotted it from the road. Dined here for the first time a couple weeks ago during one of my visits. Parking: Plentiful. Located in a large and fairly vacant plaza, there's a lot of parking.Location: Spacious and clean. Inside, there are private dining areas sectioned off by curtains as well as regular seating in the main dining area.Service: Good. If you need anything, press the button! Otherwise, the staff leaves you alone for the most part. Things I've tried:LA Galbi: Y U M! I love marinated Korean short ribs. I really enjoyed these. They came out sizzling hot and is for sure the best-tasting one I've tried in Montgomery!Pork Bulgogi: I'm not a huge fan of pork. This one was okay for me. I thought it was kind of dry compared to the beef so I didn't have much of it.Beef Tofu Noodle Soup: I really liked this one. Albeit the soup was kinda salty, the noodle soup was real tasty. Side dishes: A-OK. Side dishes vary at different restaurants. My favorites were the bean sprouts and pickled cucumbers. I would love to see japchae as a side dish!Also, I'm not sure which of our orders came with the stone bowl rice, but that was really good. Overall, I would highly recommend So Gong Dong for your Korean food cravings. The prices are relatively high compared to places like SHILLA, BUT it's definitely worth it considering their quality of food is much higher as well."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,4,Yum. There are several good Korean restaurants in Montgomery and So Gong Dong feels pretty authentic. Smells like BBQ (and so will your clothes by the time you leave) with a bunch of friends and families catching up with the day. There are a ton of private rooms and grills on the tables if you choose those dishes. I enjoyed the banchan but most especially the hot water (instead of cold water) to start. I really liked the beef bibimbap on the hot stone plate and it is a lot of food.
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,5,"This is a great Korean restaurant! When we entered, they greeted us in Korean and that was so pleasent to hear. We started off with the usual banchan they give out at any Korean restaurant and it was tasty. For dinner, we ordered a combo of kalbi and beef soondubu. Unless you're really really hungry,  a combo is more then enough to feed 2! Just ask for extra rice. We also rarely see jajangmyeon at a korean restaurant and so we just knew we had to get it and it did not disappoint. Only thing is, I wish the sauce was just a bit thicker! All and all, we would most definitely come again  (also, you know its legit when they have a call button at your table so you can get service whenever you need)"
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,5,"When in Montgomery, eat Korean food! Actually, I'll eat Korean food anywhere, but So Gong Dong was delicious from beginning to end of the meal. Since I was eating alone, grilling my own barbecue seemed like overkill, so l got my usual - kimchi pancake and beef dolsot bibimbap. Both were huge portions and came with several dishes of banchan. Everything tasted fresh, had beautifully complex flavors - smoke, spice, pungent, and sweet. So Gong Dong was not what I was expecting to eat in Montgomery, but I'm sure glad that I did."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,5,Visiting from out of town and craving Korean food randomly on a Sunday. Some of the other Korean restaurants were closed. The service here was great and the BBQ was delicious. Appreciated the tips from the servers on how to best bring out the flavors and which sides to pair with. Banchan was flavorful too. Authentic Korean food! Definitely recommend!
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,5,"While in Montgomery I was with a colleague and asked him where we should eat.  He suggested places like Chili's, Applebee's, etc...I let him know that was not going to work.  As always I went to Yelp!, and So Gong was extremely, highly rated.  I love interesting food so we decided to give it a try.We did not have time to cook at the table, which would have been a blast.  We both got the Bulgogi Hot Plate.  Before our meal arrived, they brought out 6 different plates of different veggies we could munch on.  One was kimchi, one was a spicy pickled cucumber, one plate had bean sprouts, another had spinach, or really green seaweed.  I am not sure what the rest were, I do know they were all good.When our Hot Plates arrived, man were they hot!!  The meat was well seasoned, and the veggies were tender and NOT overdone.  The best part of a Hot Plate for me is the crispy rice on the bottom, and there was lots of it.This is a great place, I would definitely go over and over.  Also, they had some really great contemporary pop Asian music playing."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,5,"What excellent Korean noodle soup (aka soon tofu). Of course we started with all the typical small side dishes, but they were even better than what I'm used to up in Boston!! The cucumber kick was excellent, so fresh. The bean sprouts had a good amount of other toppings, I especially liked the green onions with it, and one dish was fried lotus, which I never had before and was really good. For the main, I had the vegetarian and my hubby had the kimchi soup. I loved my soup because it was super flavorful, full of veggies, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I was SO full at the end. I wasn't able to completely finish it but I got close. The kimchi variety had a little bit of beef in it, but mostly kimchi.The staff was attentive and was always moving around quickly and getting things done! We were served a second round of appetizer dishes before we could even request it. This isn't a super nice setting and there are some TVs in the background, but it fits the need for comfort food, or just Korean food! We saw mostly Koreans coming in to eat, so I have to assume the quality is there."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,4,Omg thank goodness for Yelp! I found this hidden gem that was so authentic and delicious.  It is a bit pricey .  I don't recommend the shrimp fried rice it was not good at all. The rest of the dishes we had was good.  The waitress Definitely could use more attention skills as I had wave to her about 3-4 times for her to take our order and for her to give me my check. The place was clean and very authentic.  I enjoyed my time despite the few hiccups we had while there.
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,3,"I gave this place a second chance and the service again was bad but I noticed it was just this male waiter. The woman was so nice to me but the male would give me a dirty look if I asked for anything and if I did, the woman would bring me whatever it was I asked for...the food was good. I got the haemul kalgooksoo soon tofu, I wish it had more seafood. It only had two pieces of oysters, two pieces of shrimp and a few clams. The oysters were really good but for a dish labeled seafood, it wasn't very seafood-y. The poor service made me feel pretty sucky after my meal. I don't think I'll go back a third time"
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,5,"this place is by far the tastiest korean restaurant i've been to in america. i have been to several restaurants in alabama, georgia, and new york, and i prefer here. i always get tofu soup with beef & seafood, spiciest flavor. soo goodthe LA galbi is recommended also. their side dishes are very fresh and tasty. the kimchi is always my favorite."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,1,"So sorry,  not good at all.  I grew up with a  Koreain family and they made the best bulgogi this was nothing whatsoever like I remember. It cost me 50 bucks for some beef rice and doublings I would not recommend the place. The beef had no glaxe or barbecue sauce it was plain like a Chinese Stir fry"
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,4,Had some great Korean food. The bulgogi looked amazing but I went for the short ribs which were just fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised!
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,1,"I took my family to So Gong Dong for dinner.  They provide a menu.  On the menu you can order meat for a price that you then cook at your table.  There is a picture for pork belly that shows 6 slices for $20.95.  When they deliver the meat you get 3 slices and they say that it is an order for 1.  If you want all 6 slices you have to order 2 portions which is 41.90.  I said the picture in the menu is what we should get for the price (6 slices for $20.95). They didn't offer a rational explanation but just said that was how they do it.  One girl even said they were just internet photos and we couldn't rely on them.The short ribs were even worse.  6 in the picture for $34.95 but you only get 2.It is an absolute rip off.  I will find out if the state enforces it false advertising statute or not.  In the meantime, save yourself the hassle and feeling of being cheated and do not patronize this establishment.Final kicker... I have a stomach ache after eating their food."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,5,"Montgomery has a lot of great restaurants and this is definitely one of them. I was able to visit So Gong Dong for the first time back in March while staying at the Drury and it quickly became one of my favorite restaurants in Alabama. At that time I tried the Dumpling Hot Pot soup and that broth Stole.The.Show. I could slurpity slurp that for daaaayyysss. Except eventually your start feeling the oil and garlic seeping from your pores and you think maybe a detox bath would be nice. BAH! :-) The complimentary Banchan is really great as well. For kimchi lovers you'll scoff at the next place that serves you complimentary chips and salsa. I've been alone during both visits so all Banchan is mine. muah haha. So I love to not only snack on it while I wait for my entree but also to mix it into the dish I ordered.My second time almost didn't occur. I was actually sitting in the parking lot of another restaurant and I thought back to my first visit and I changed directions back to So Gong Dong. We don't have a place like this in Birmingham so I knew I had to take advantage again while in town. Plus I was certain I would get the delicious meal I was seeking. I ordered the beef bibimbop and it's not just fun to say but also tasty to eat. You get a delicious protein and lots of fresh veggies with a sticky side of white rice. (mouth water emoji). Bless the waiter's heart that squatted down next to my table and instructed me to ""put rice in bowl and add sauce"". I had my Asian street cred card pulled the second I replied that I don't eat a lot of rice. But despite not eating a lot of rice I had plenty for dinner and to take for lunch the next time. Heck yeah for frugality!There are NUMEROUS Korean establishments in this area but I'm going to have a hard time visiting any others."
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,3,"Ate here a few times. The food was great but overall, too expensive for the portion sizes. I don't know if it was too much to ask, it was almost too difficult at times to ask for extra portions in some of the banchans. Tofu noodle soup is the way to go though. One of my favorites!"
So Gong Dong Tofu & BBQ,4,They have really great food and prices ain't so bad.My only problem was the menu was very small.And if you don't like seafood there are isn't much for you to eat.Other than that the food is great and fast service.
Wharf Casual Seafood,5,I was pleasantly surprised to find the Wharf on my back to Atlanta from NOLA. The price was good for the portion.The Wharf is the perfect blend of casual dining and atmosphere with more upscale choices likeLobster tails and salmon. Order at the counter and have a seat. The wait won't take too long but be patient as the food is cooked to order. They will bring it to you piping hot. The cashier was very nice and so was the server. Parking was easy and it didn't take long. I would definitely go back.
Wharf Casual Seafood,5,"I forgot I visited this place back in August 2017 when we drove my daughter to college and then decided to revisit this place again May 2018. Funny, we tried them on move-in day... and again on move-out day. We had shrimp po-boys, handmade hush puppies and southern red beans & rice. Talk about good eating  ME my daughter and my sister truly enjoyed the whole experience. Fresh food clean restaurant happy atmosphere great service. If I ever get back to Montgomery, I'll definitely make this a must-have. It was very delicious and they get five stars from me!"
Wharf Casual Seafood,3,"Because I travel so much for my career,  when in a city - I look for local spots and not a chain! I found this just googling & it was a very clean restaurant with very nice employees. I ordered the Destin Platter which came with Grouper, a Crab Cake, Shrimp (everything fried crispy), Hushpuppies, with 2 sides = $18.99. I got the garlic green beans with red beans and rice as my sides. Garlic green beans were great,  but the red beans and rice not so much (hence the 3 star rating). I'm use to the red beans being put on top of the rice verses them being mixed together and you can't even tell if rice is within the red beans. I was very satisfied with everything else though.  They also serve wine & beer which is always a plus. I would definitely visit again, but just change up my choice of side!"
Wharf Casual Seafood,5,"This was called new shrimp and grit, it came with shrimp, bacon and goat cheese with a White herb cream sauce. This was my First  time going to this place, and my First time having grits because I am from midwest! The staff was friendly  and attention. I cant wait to go back!"
Wharf Casual Seafood,4,"I would pick Wharf Seafood over some other places like Capitol Oyster House. It feels fresh and clean. The service isn't bad but they usually only have 2 people taking orders, delivering food and clearing tables. Military discount is offered on Mondays. - Fish Sandwich (fried, grilled or blackened tilapia): I chose the blacked fish and a half a filet came on a soft brioche bun with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. It was delicious. I wish there was more fish. And the collard greens are good but like typical Montgomery style, it was salty for me. - Tacos: Be sure to ask for the lunch portion if you'd like 2 tacos versus the full 3 taco serving. That's still a lot for me."
Wharf Casual Seafood,4,"I was looking for something different to eat and didn't want to go anywhere we had in Birmingham. I found this place on Yelp of course and man this place is a sleeper of you haven't been by yet. Once we entered, we were greeted and the lady at the counter was very helpful in helping us decide what to eat. We had the bacon wrapped shrimp, fried shrimp, catfish and grits and catfish with collard greens and red beans and rice. Where do I start? The bacon wrapped shrimp were awesome! The bacon wrapped was fried onto the shrimp and the were still plump and not dried out. The shrimp are pretty big so be careful. The catfish is fried to perfection. I love a place that serves real farmed raised fish. The grits were thick and creamy. They use stone ground grits which are the best. The red beans and rice were better than any I've ever had. They had beans that weren't soupy and still had texture but full of flavor. The collards tastes like Sunday dinner. The Asian slaw had so many different flavor but they all blended together to make a great side dish.This is my new go to when I'm traveling 65 South!"
Wharf Casual Seafood,5,"Blackened Grouper, garlic green beans wonderful. A surprising find in a strip center this far from the ocean. Easy order at the counter friendly service and good food brought your table. Highly recommend this even if like us you're on the highway heading home to Atlanta It's 5 minutes off of 85 and worth the stop."
Wharf Casual Seafood,1,Menu prices are different than actual costs. I asked to speak to the manager about it and he wouldn't even come out and talk to me about it. They need to hire a new manager.
Wharf Casual Seafood,4,"We got to the restaurant at about 8 pm. on Sunday.  We were greeted by Callie with great enthusiasm. It was our first time here, and we had questions.  Callie answered our questions, and made some great suggestions.We ordered blackened grouper and grilled Catfish, and they were awesome.  We also ordered fried green tomatoes as an appetizer, and we were very pleased with the taste, texture, and flavor.  My blackened fish was cooked perfectly.Our food was hot and presented nicely on our plates.  We ordered Pecan pie and it was first served to us cold in a styrofoam to go container.  I don't know if Callie thought we were taking it with us. We asked for it to be heated and she obliged.Good food fair price"
Wharf Casual Seafood,5,Finally found a Gem while Traveling The US!!!A little expensive but it's worth it! I will be coming back here real soon
Wharf Casual Seafood,5,"Went there for the first time today the atmosphere in the restaurant was good. We went right when they opened up on a Thursday. After we ordered a lot more people started coming in. Wait time was about 10 min. Anyways, on to the food,  I had the shrimp tacos with red bead and rice which were excellent. My husband had the catfish with a side of red beans and rice and cheese grits. Only complaint he had was that there wasn't enough rice in the red beans and rice. We also had some crab claws for our appetizer which were good. I would recommend this restaurant and I will definitely come back next time I'm in town."
Wharf Casual Seafood,3,"This restaurant has been opened for about 2 years, and the cashier mentioned that they were planning on opening another location or two, one location in East Chase.There were a few things that I was disappointed with on this visit. One was when I placed my order. The entree's state that it comes with two sides. There is a list of regular sides and a list of premium sides for an additional $0.99. When I ordered the Cheddar Cheese Grits from the regular side, the cashier asked nonchalantly if I wanted it loaded, but failed to mention that it would be an extra charge. And nowhere on the menu does it say that either. I wish she would have disclosed that information when asking customers. The other issue I had on this visit was that the food took a very long time to be prepared. During the work days, I don't have a whole lot of time during lunch to wait around for my food.The food itself was good. We ordered the Shrimp entree with Cheddar Cheese Grits and Natural Cut Fries, as well as the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp with Garlic Green Beans and Brussels Sprouts (the brussels sprouts are an extra charge). All entrees also came with Hushpuppies. I thought the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp was well worth the extra amount I paid for it. The fries were pretty standard, but all the other sides were very good. I'm not a huge fan of hushpuppies, but they tasted ok.The interior is clean, and you order and pay at the register before you seat yourselves. Overall, as stated above, there was the omitted extra charges and slowness of the food. But I liked the food and would be willing to give the new location a chance once it opens."
Wharf Casual Seafood,4,The Warf Casual Seafood has several locations but only one in the Montgomery area. They really life up to the causal dinning experience.You order at the counter and they bring the meal to your table. They have beer and wine but they don't have a bar.I had the fried crab claw platter. Fried Crabs are very popular in this region of the country and the Warf does a great job preparing them. They breading that they use to fry the claws is well seasoned and they claws were fried to perfection. You can still taste the freshness of the crab. I got the crab claw platter it comes with 2 sides and sweet hush puppies. I got the red beans and rice fries. You can get the claws and most of the seafood broiled blackened or crispy.We also got a fried oyster po boy that also came with fries. The oysters were also fried to perfection. They can with fries on a toasted buttered French roll with lettuce and tomato.I really like how they give out nice grey Warf Casual Seafood cups when you order a beverage!
Wharf Casual Seafood,4,I enjoyed my lunch here...it was a little pricey-- but portion sizes were good.I would have liked for them to have smaller portions that cost less...but I'm just a consumer ;)
Wharf Casual Seafood,4,"My first time at the Wharf! So many choices, not enough time. If you get petite gumbo it's a huge bowl. I ordered The Wharf Burger with sweet potato fries $ 13.98."
Wharf Casual Seafood,4,I was recommended to check out the Ward by some coworkers. I'm not a big seafood guy but decided to check it out cause it's next door and I was taking a short lunch and couldn't go far. Even tho it's counter service the staff is coming by checking on guest which I thought was nice. I got a chicken Po'Boy and fries. The fries were great but the chicken for the Po'Boy was kind of bland.  The warf sauce kind of helped with the blandness of the chicken. Overall it was a good dinning experience.
Wharf Casual Seafood,4,"Bookmarked this restaurant as a spot I must try while I was visiting.     I was hoping the food was going to be worth it! First it's in a shopping plaza.   Luckily it's situated on the corner.   Easy to spot from the street.      The inside atmosphere is definitely casual.   Nothing too spiffy, but nice.     I was indecisive as to what I wanted to try.   I ordered a combo with blackened mahi mahi and shrimp.  My sides were the garlic green beans and the mayo based sweet cole slaw.    The serving amount was worth the $14.99 + tax.     My disappointment was that I wanted fried shrimp. I was told I couldn't mix the cooking style.   That's dumb!  Don't you have to cook it anyway???  Lost one star.  I didn't order anything to.drink, but they have a varied selection.  Soda, lemonade, tea, beer, sangria!   I really wanted a sangria...next time I'm visiting I'll have a glass and it was only $3.Anyway, stop by.  Give it a try.   I will be back one day!  Oh yeah......it was good! Lol"
Wharf Casual Seafood,2,"Very basic seafood overpriced for the amount given. DONT choose the collard greens, extremely over salted with no flavor. Great staff though and clean."
Wharf Casual Seafood,5,After learning from the cashier that the fish was frozen and not fresh I was disappointed.... so I ordered the Shrimp Poboy and living in NOLA makes me a tough Poboy critic but Whaft DELIVERED y'all!!They were a little skimpy on the shrimp but definitely made up for it in taste! .... Oh and the cheese grits were TO DIE for!! I'm sold and as long as I have to come back to Montgomery I'll be sure to stop and grab a bite.
Wharf Casual Seafood,5,Great food! In town on business and glad I chose this spot. I ordered the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese-on point! Shrimp and grits were a hit as well!
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,Ordered takeout on our trip through Montgomery   Excellent fried chicken and catfish.  Sides were fresh and hot.  Beautiful service.  Thank you!!
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,"Just got in to town and saw her soul food place! What a smart idea to stop in here instead of a fast food place! I had oxtail with black eyed peas and collard greens. Food was great, the hospitality from the owNer was just as great! Take the time to pop in for home cooking y'all! I'll be back"
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,"Stop whatever you are doing and stop in this place of perfection. We stopped after the reading the reviews on YELP and it lived up to the hype! The fried catfish (bone in) and Alabama style chicken wings were seasoned with mouth watering flavor and fried to perfection. But the pork chop sandwich was proof God loves me! The French fries  are golden crispy heaven. But most importantly Momma T (Theresa) was the  exact blessing I needed in my life today. This gem  of a place should not be missed. It's the true definition of soul food: It nourishes your body and more importantly your spirit.  God Bless you! -Jen and Craig from Fort Worth, TX!!"
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,4,"Some friends and I stopped in to Bevertte's on our day trip to Montgomery on a Sunday. We were in search a good home cooked meal and we definitely found this and more here. Although we met a bit of a crowd, the host was very helpful ensuring everyone was aware of the wait and thanked us for our patience. The food was amazing. I ordered the friend chicken, Mac and cheese and yams. The portion size was more than enough. While we were waiting, the owner offered everyone free drinks to compensate for our wait. If you're looking for a welcoming family vibe, this is definitely the place to check out."
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,I was told to stop by here by a Waffle House employee and my expectations were exceeded the staff and cook make sure they create a welcoming environment I felt like I was truly at home and not somewhere just going out to eat about the food I ordered the ox tails with Mac and cheese candied yams and cabbage and the food was amazing thank you for the experience anytime your in town this place is a must go and they give a military discount
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,4,"The oxtails were good. I liked the gravy, on the menu it said it came with yellow rice but they gave me white. It's forgivable, but I was looking forward to some yellow rice. They were very tender and I enjoyed them. I gave my husband my cornbread so I can't speak on that. The macaroni and cheese was ok, it was like school mac&cheese. So not bad, but I probably wouldn't order it again. The potato salad was good."
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,"The outside appearance makes it look like a hole in the wall. To me, that usually signifies a very tasty, hidden gem. Walked in and was a big overwhelmed with the smell of fried fish. However, I have a super sensitive sense of smell. Ordered chicken breast with Mac n cheese, and collard greens. I don't think I've ever inhaled greens as fast as I did these. O.m.g. The mac n cheese was homemade and tasty. The fried chicken breast was amazing. Thankful I don't live in Montgomery, Al bc I would be at this joint entirely too much if I did."
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,4,"Walked in & was given a huge welcome by Ms. Teresa! She is super sweet & down to earth. Her personality is just as wonderful as the food. I ordered the oxtails with rice,  collard greens,  and dressing. I think my favorite thing was the collard greens! Somebody really put their foot in them! I also got the peach cobbler! Thank goodness I don't stay in the area or anywhere near Montgomery - I would be here all the time."
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,3,"I visited while in the city  of Montgomery  and the food was so, so ,meaning not good . Mostly out of the can ."
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,"Talk about Southern Hospitality! This place is quite the hole in the wall in a lil shopping center...But the kindness of the staff was beyond measure & the food was delicious! Fried Okra, black eyed peas, crispy on the outside juicy on the inside fried chicken! Oxtails! Omg so good! Thank you JWB's for making our visit to the south so memorable!"
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,Wow! Well thank goodness Montgomery has good food! We've been on a road trip for over a week and things have been lacking in the food department. Thank you thank you for home cooking and DELIVERED!!
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,"I went here to pick up some food based upon one a yelp review plus the times they are open.  I have said this before for other locations in many places, Ms Teresa, I'm not sure if she took my order or not, but this is the name on my receipt, has the best oxtail I have ever had and I mean really the best ever, fall off the bone kind of stuff.  I also had the greens and black eyed peas, which had a unique taste.  I think some sugar may have added which made them better.  Ms Teresa was more than welcoming to me, being a white guy ordering oxtail.  What can I say,  they taste like roast and are really good and this by far was the best ever.  I will be back when in the Montgomery area."
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,"Great homemade cookin...it was just like myGramma's cookin from my childhood ...fried chicken was juicy and well seasoned, crispy deliciousness, the Mac and cheese was some of the best I've ever had, potato salad was refreshing and delicious ...I will definitely order again! Highly recommended!"
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,Everything about thIs restaurant is amazing! We walked in and were greeted by the most friendly lady who happened to be the owner. We felt right at home when we walked in and had a seat after we ordered and enjoyed the music. The food surpassed any soul food I have ever eaten - and I have eaten a LOT. I wish we lived closer so I could eat here more often but will be stopping back by any time I come through Montgomery. I highly recommend checking this place out if you want delicious soul food and a friendly face
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,Super nice and fast service. Food was great and so were portions! Everything tasted delicious!
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,"Nothing in this establishment is good for you, but heavens, all of it is utterly delicious. As other reviewers have pointed out, the fried chicken in particular is incredible, with crispy skin and juicy meat that is simply indescribable.On top of that, the staff are great, but the lady who runs the place is probably in the top five of Nicest People In The World. She always finds some reason to give me a little extra food, as if I needed any more, because the portions are more than generous. In short, if you visit, you will not be sorry."
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,"Unbelievable. I will never eat fried chicken again, because now I have had the best. The. Best. (I am from out of town, otherwise I would be eating this fried chicken at least once a week.) The cornbread dressing was amazing. The homemade poundcake was a blessing. This is the Lord's food."
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,4,"I had their oxtails, rice fried okra and dressing. Although the oxtails were small in size, they were big on flavor. The okra was really good. I didn't care for their dressing!! The guy behind the counter was very friendly and provided great service."
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,I visited this restaurant two times this week. I had oxtails the first time and fried chicken the second time I visited. Both meals were very good. The customer service was impeccable. I would definitely recommend dining at Beverette's Soul Food! When choosing your sides you have to try the collard greens they are very very good.
J. W. Beverette’s Soul Food,5,"Wow, is all I can say! The Oxtails just melted in my mouth and the cabbage and fried okra were the perfect compliments. Service was excellent and I will be sure to come back when I'm back in the area again."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,"I came here with a friend for the lunch buffet. We both really like Indian food and she had been suggesting Saffron to me for awhile, so we decided to go for lunch one day. Saffron is definitely the best Indian restaurant in Montgomery. All the other restaurants I've tried have had somewhat bland food, but Saffron's buffet was absolutely delicious. Everything was spiced so well (in terms of spice flavoring and in terms of spicy/heat level). I honestly enjoyed everything I tried from the buffet. I can't remember the name of the dish, but I really loved the dish that had diced potatoes (kind of like a hash) which appeared to be pan fried. They had some heat that would build up over time, but they were just sooo good. The fried naan (again, I can't remember it's specific name) was incredible. I hadn't ever had it before, but I couldn't resist sticking up on it during every trip to the buffet line. It only tasted even better when I dipped it in some of the tikka masala. My only complaint is that the naan on the buffet was never refilled while we were there, so we didn't get any fresh naan to try. I didn't mind this, however, because I was so content with the fried naan. The employees were very nice and attentive to us the entire time were in the restaurant. I believe the buffet was about $13, which is expensive for a regular lunch, but is totally worth it when compared to the quality of the food. I believe my favorite Indian restaurant where I used to live had a very similar price point for its lunch buffet."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,4,"Me and a few buddies came here for their lunch buffet on a Saturday late morning (11AM) and were starving. It was essentially brunch and we havent ate breakfast. So right when they opened, we came in and we started eating and eating. The weekend price is a little bit more than their weekday, but overall we were pretty impressed with the quality of food. We were really surprised to find some decent quality indian cuisine in the Montgomery area, but we are glad we came to try it out. They had different kinds of rice, and different curries with chicken, potatoes, and goat. The curry goat was my favorite since lamb and goat is generally my favorite type of meat. I had maybe 3 plates of just curry goat with rice. They also had fresh naan bread to dip your curry. We left stuffed and it sat heavy where when we got back, we all took a nice nap. Productive Saturday in Montgomery."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,"Well Montgomery is full of surprises! How about a terrific Indian restaurant and I mean really GREAT. Don't expect starched tablecloths here- the decor is simple but nice and clean. However the food is outstanding, 5 star quality food, not at all americanized, in fact what I'd expect to find in San Francisco, Los Angeles or NYC, not In the South where BBQ and fried chicken reign. The owner of Saffron Indian Kitchen explained she changes her dishes each day. Laying out smaller portions so it needs to be made fresh each day and isn't  wasted. We arrived a half hour before closing when you'd be lucky to get anything or dishes can be old and tired... not at Saffron. The dishes were all fresh and tasty and unusually high quality, especially  at a lunch buffet. They had the traditional rice pudding, but theirs was made with high quality saffron and rose water. They have vegetarian dishes as well as goat or lamb curry. Then have a special dish like the shrimp mailei from the South. They try to feature dishes from all the major regions in India, everything is made from scratch!This is one Southern Belle I'd like to see succeed."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,"I attended the Vegan Social | Saffron Indian Kitchen here which was a huge hit. The place was packed! Delicious food such as the Jackfruit Halwa,  which was like a bread pudding. Normally some items are not vegan (Naan bread is not vegan) but menu is clearly labeled. Great customer service at the event. The host made you feel right at home.  Looking forward to the next event & will visit this place again!"
Saffron Indian Kitchen,4,"So I've had the buffet here twice and it's been pretty good each time. Only being disappointed by one or two items. But after tonight I'd say skip the buffet all together and just order off the menu. Of course Indian food is often expensive because of all the work put into the sauces. But it's worth it. There are items on the menu that are totally worth trying but I may never see them on the buffet because of the work involved making them or maybe they just want to put out the more popular type dishes ""Americans"" like. First: Malai Kofta - this is a vegetarian dish of veggie dumplings in a creamy cashew sauce. It's so good!! My sister and I liked it even over the meat dishes. It's rich and creamy but without feeling heavy.Second: Paneer Makhani - this dish has been on the buffet before, but of course it taste much better fresh. The tomato sauce is creamy and smooth. Third: Gobi Manchurian- this is a fried cauliflower dish that's spicy. If ordering in house it will probably keep it's crunch. But I ordered out so the steam from it being packed up took a bit of that away. But it was still amazing! They have some Indo-Chinese dishes and this tasted like one of them. Almost like a GeneralTso's chicken but with cauliflower instead. Very good and just the right level of spiciness. I'm definitely going to go back and order off the menu again. Definitely worth the price and I'd like to see if the dishes that I was disappointed by on the buffet are better off menu."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,"If you are in town and you miss this place, you have done yourself a wrong. This is probably some of the best Indian food I have had. Better than any Atlanta restaurant. We got an assortment of plates. Dosa, pratha, chaat, chicken, lamb. All was excellent. I hear they have a lunch buffet too.  Nice people. Clean restaurant.  If I find myself in the area again I will be back."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,2,"I love Indian food, and prefer it over anything else, so you know I was excited when I visited my hometown. I remember eating at this location for dinner (a while back) and I love it. My hubby and I came for the lunch buffet,but sadly, we were disappointed. Very disappointed. I'm wondering if it is under the same management. There was such a vast difference in the dinner food and the lunch food. The samosas and pakora were great. The dal and paneer were awful in my opinion. I've had my fair share of dal, and this one had a bland taste. The paneer was bland but sweet aftertaste. The server was not attentive. I think she was more focused on setting up for dinnertime. The owner talked with the other guests, but she didn't say much to us.I won't be returning especially for the lunch buffet."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,"I really love this place for number of reasons. First, the food is amazing and freshly prepared. Secondly, the owner is local and highly attentive. I recently placed a to go order and was given the wrong food. However, right before arriving home the owner called and delivered my correct order in person. This is the reason to eat local. Great job."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,4,"Dinner buffet Saturday evening @5:30.Best cauliflower veggie option I ever had Chicken option with visible long red peppers was very tasted but not hot as the peppers would suggest Excellent ground lamb  Service was outstanding5 or 6 staffers on the floor Off the 25 booths and tables 5 were  It has been two months since my last visit.The staff has been working hard on ambience changes.The buffet bar as moved to an easier to navigate straight line.   The desert bar is new, I think.  The walls are decorated by mostly string instruments.The service as always is outstanding. The food contues to rank amough the best."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,Delicious food. Nice staff. Good prices. Décor and ambiance are kinda stripmall-y. Expect some Ballywood dancing on the TVs. Buffet has a nice selection. The menu is terrific; don't be afraid to order menu items instead of the buffet - you won't regret it.
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,The lunch buffet is a great value and a good way to try many different flavors. Also a good way to try Indian cuisine for the first time.
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,"Excellent meal.We had eaten at an Indian restaurant a few years ago here in town and were underwhelmed by the experience. Not so at Saffron.We are very much novices, but the owner made great efforts to help us along and suggest dishes we would enjoy.There were five of us and I like each of the other's entrees as well as mine.At the owner's suggestion, we got two different kinds of mulligatawny soup and both were delicious.My entree was a creamy lamb curry, not too spicy, that was divine.  I saved part of it for lunch the next day.  My wife got chicken kabobs, but she thought it s bit too spicy, but still tasty.  That is alright, I'll get to enjoy it for lunch later this week.The front of house was clean as were the toilets.  Only complaint is that the hand dryer was broken in the men's toilet and there was no hand paper. 9.5/10  -0.5 for the broken dryer."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,"I normally do not do buffets as I find them lacking quality in the food. Saffron was a pleasant surprise. The Food quality is high. Everything was hot and fresh. Very flavorful and just enough spice. You could taste all the ingredients and not just ""salt"" at typical buffets. The staff was also very friendly and attentive. This is now one of my go to places for lunch."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,4,They had vegan festival going on so service was really off which I understand. Food was really good. Authentic. A little pricey maybe. Would like to Coen again on a regular day and see their service
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,WOWZA! Nothing else to say but the best indian buffet i've ever had. Every item I tasted was exceptional especially the fish and shrimp entrees. The chicken tikka marsala was amazing and had a unique smokey flavor that was something that i never tasted before. I highly recommend you stop by and try it for yourself. I live over an hour away and when I want Indian food this is where i come.
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,"So I'd been hearing about this restaurant for a while and decided to check it out. Must say it is a very nice restaurant. Decor is simple and true to tradition they even play Indian music which was a plus. I had the vegetable Biryani with naan, Aloo, Goat curry, Tandoori chicken, Chicken tikka masala, Chicken curry, and Mango Ice cream. Food was hot and fresh. All of it was very delicious you get the items that are most popular to sample. Next time I will definitely order from the menu since I'm still new to the food. My daughter really loved the tandoori chicken and she is one picky eater."
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,"This place was a very welcome surprise. I had a six week training in Montgomery and managed to eat here four times! The food was very flavorful and buffet was well stocked. The buffet is quite cheap for what you get, and dinner is a little more pricey. The service is awesome! Lastly, it's clean and the ambiance is quite nice. Definitely recommend!"
Saffron Indian Kitchen,2,"The quality of food used to be good here but it has dropped sharply recently I ordered biryani and had quiet the same experience twice , got just plain rice with masala sad to see a good restaurant do this for the price they charge"
Saffron Indian Kitchen,5,Wow such amazing flavors and textures! Their buffet has a great selection. I am not an Indian food conesour but this food is delicious. A great alternative to the mundane meat and threes
Saffron Indian Kitchen,3,"I will say the food is good. Customer service is ok but a little bit slow. The Indian salad is great however it seemed Everytime we went it started getting smaller and smaller. Even when we ordered some to go it seemed even smaller. I would recommend this place, however, I would note it is on the pricey side."
Martin’s Restaurant,5,"Essential stop to eat in Montgomery! If you're going to visit one restaurant in town, go here! You'll be surrounded by locals. You'll get a plateful of home-cooked food for $10. Sweet tea for $1. Huge slices of pie for $3 each! Amazing friendly service. Fast service! Plenty of parking. Plenty of seating. Clean bathrooms. Not far from I-85 and I-65. Try the Fried Chicken Pulleys! It will be the most tender, juicy, meaty and crispy fried chicken you've ever tasted in your life!! The side portions are enough to eat half and save half. And you should save half and order a piece of pie! The coconut meringue is a tower of sweet and delightful! Don't miss this spot, foodies!!!!"
Martin’s Restaurant,3,"Got in sort of late on Wednesday night and wanted to go somewhere that was very ""Montgomery.""  After a little research, Martin's seemed like our best bet.  It's been open a crazy long time and offers typical meat and three, home cooking options.  It's a fairly spacious restaurant.  Decor isn't really my style, but it's simplistic and comfortable and it's fun how they highlighted the restaurant's history.The service was a mixed bag; two ladies waited on us, and one was really frazzled and tired and mixed up all three of our drinks, while the other also seemed a little tired but still on top of it.  Overall, they were both pleasant and our food came out quickly.  The lady working the cash register was lovely -- she'd been working at Martin's for over 30 years.  Wow! We all ordered the fried chicken with two sides.  Between us, we got butter peas, macaroni and cheese, and collard greens.  Hot corn muffins were also brought out to the table; though they weren't super flavorful, I enjoyed their warmth and toastiness, and they were good with a pat of butter on top!  I thought the chicken was pretty good -- I enjoyed the breading and the flavor.  Not among the best ever, but solid.  My mom's was sadly pretty dried out, though.  The butter peas were definitely the best side, cooked to the right softness and nice and salty.On the downside, the macaroni and cheese had basically no flavor and was an unpleasant, mushy texture, and the collard greens were also not very good.  Also, the sweet tea wasn't CLOSE to sweet enough for me, which is unusual at a meat and three!Also worth noting -- I'm guessing they do a big lunch business, because they were out of a lot of options by the time we got there at 6:30.  No steak tips left, and not a single dessert left except for banana pudding.  A shame, because I really wanted to try a slice of their chocolate pie.  On the whole, not a terrible experience; but if I find myself in Montgomery again, I'll probably be trying something else."
Martin’s Restaurant,1,"Martin's is full of hype and potential, but unfortunately was a huge dissappointment. We specifically asked for fresh chicken when we ordered. Unfortunately, when it was lukewarm and dry. So we asked for fresh pieces of chicken. They took our chicken back, but then when the ""new"" chicken arrived it was clear it was older pieces reheated. The ""new"" chicken was warm, however, it was completely dried out and lacked any juiciness when you poked it with a fork. So major fail....On top of it, the mashed potatoes were instant. The corn bread muffins have absolutely no flavor. The macaroni and cheese was also sorely dissapointing. I really don't get the hype and is clear restaurant management don't care about the quality of the food. Did they really think we would be that stupid to not realize the ""fresh"" chicken was simply dried out chicken reheated......"
Martin’s Restaurant,3,"A very traditional ""meat and three.""  Locals recommend it, but not necessarily for the food.  You can find tastier food at many places around town, but the draw here is the history (not particularly favorable), the warm hearts serving and making the food, and the fried chicken.  Also, you'll probably never see the uncommon side ""Pineapple and Cheese"" offered up at many other restaurants.  Try it.  The okra and the turnip greens were nothing special, a bit bland,  The mini corn bread muffins cried out for something, anything, to make them tastier.  The sweet potato casserole is a must order, and closer to to a dessert than anything else.  The sweet potato pie was classic and yummy.If you want to eat at place that has been central to the history of Montgomery, with none of the ""show"" or foodie credentials, this is the place."
Martin’s Restaurant,3,"Walked in at 6pm for dinner. The restaurant is the typical ""meat and three"" where you pick an entree and 3 sides. We got fresh corn muffins, but they were bland in flavor. I came in wanting the country fried steak, but they were sold out, so I got the Chopped steak w/ turnip greens, rice with gravy and mash. The only warm thing on my plate were my sides and my chopped steak was sadly cold. It's like they make a whole batch for the day and they just sit out or something. So 1 star for my meal. My Husband got the fried chicken and it was fresh, hot and crispy. If anything, just come for the chicken because it was the only good thing on his plate. Turnip greens were ok, and the mashed potatoes taste instant. Would we go again? Probably just for the chicken and that's it"
Martin’s Restaurant,5,"Good local food....definitely down home southern cooking.  This restaurant is very close to Maxwell AFB, good for groups, large portions, reasonable prices and friendly staff.  I met my friend for dinner one night while I was in town and we both ordered the ribs.  They were very tender and tasty.  We both thought our sides were great as well.  The sweet potato casserole was good enough to be pie!  :-)We didn't try the desserts because we were so full, but I hear the pies are fantastic.  Thanks for a great dinner!"
Martin’s Restaurant,5,Our guide Montgomery tours jake took us to this restaurant the fried chicken was perfect all 5 agreed  ( I am. Vegetarian) and the lemon Meringue was fabulous best meringue  ever  ( I did taste that I The waitress was so nice !!!answer all questions with that southern  accent This is not a restaurant for anyone on diet or vegetarian but for a taste of old south food this is a good start
Martin’s Restaurant,4,"Oh boy! Mighty fine corn muffins with all its fixins. Husband and I both had the vegetable plate - black eyed peas, green beans, stuffing with gravy! I also had the sweet tea and pecan pie.Our friend had the fried chicken and the other had turkey & gravy. We left with more corn bread muffins to go and our pies.Totally satisfied!"
Martin’s Restaurant,2,"I expected great things from Martin's, given the reviews and it's induction into AL.com's restaurant hall-of-fame. Unfortunately, the experience was hit-or-miss. I'll start with the hits: the fried chicken, corn bread, and the sweet tea. The fried chicken is probably the best bone-in fried chicken I've ever had. The batter is perfect, not too much coating the chicken, good flavor, and keeps the chicken moist and tender. The cornbread is delicious, not too sweet, crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. The same with the sweet tea, not too sweet and well balanced. My wife enjoyed the pickled beets as well. Unfortunately everything else was disappointing, particularly the pie. My wife got a slice of lemon, and I got a slice of butterscotch to take home. We ended up chucking them both. The lemon tasted like the smell of lemon-scented Pine Sol, and the butterscotch didn't have much butterscotch flavor, just sweet. Not worth the calories at all. The black-eyed peas I had as a side were pretty boring, as were my wife's turnip greens. The mashed potatoes and gravy were smooth, but otherwise not special.As others have mentioned, the wait staff seems pretty downtrodden. I get that the place is busy, and it's a no-frills restaurant, but they all just seemed sad.The overall experience? The chicken is worth it, but the sides and service bring everything back to a sad reality and a trip not worth repeating. It's too bad, really."
Martin’s Restaurant,4,"The fried chicken was delicious!! The skin was crispy and perfectly seasoned.  The chicken was juicy too!  The breading on the catfish was delicious.  The catfish had a strong fish taste.  The sides were meh.  The coleslaw was delicious.  The candied yams were good.  The mac and cheese was not tasty at all.  The mashed potatoes and gravy was okay.  Overall, the chicken rocked my world!  The sides just took up unnecessary room in my belly that I should have saved for the chicken."
Martin’s Restaurant,5,"On the hunt for a good southern meal, we tripped upon Martin's. Excellent service and dynamite food. Fried chicken, greens, mashed potatoes and gravy, fresh cornbread and sweet tea. Doesn't get better than that. And very inexpensive. Highly recommend this place."
Martin’s Restaurant,5,"Oh, Martin's. How dost I love thee?!The hubster and I stopped here in June, on our meander back to Orlando from PA. I know, that's a weird meander, but that's how we do things. I searched online, as I do, for awesome spots to eat along our winding way. Martin's Restaurant popped up for the best fried chicken. So we stopped. We were not disappointed. The chicken is well-seasoned, moist, and yummy. The crispy, crunchy coating was freaking perfect. Not too thick, not too thin. I mean, if Goldilocks were looking for chicken, she'd definitely stop here. The collards and green beans were equally delicious. I can't find anything negative to say about this place, except that it's too far from Orlando. But I suppose my thighs are happy about that. Because that pie, y'all. It's a vision. That butterscotch pie is so divine, it'll take over your every waking thought. I mean, I even put it as my screensaver. Service is provided with a smile and your sweet tea cup will never go dry. Stop by and grab some chicken, but save room for that pie!"
Martin’s Restaurant,4,"We visited Montgomery to visit the Peace and Justice Memorial and asked the staff where to eat and all three said Martin's after said fried chicken. WOW! The chicken was amazing, crispy, flavorful, and huge portions! I had the green beans, black eyed peas, rice and gravy. All good except the rice was not hot enough. The cornbread was the best ever, with a nice exterior crunch and soft inside. Finished up with sweet potato pie and it hit the spot. Our server, Kim, was so friendly and helpful too! I wish we had a Martin's in California! If I'm ever in Montgomery again, I'm definitely going back!"
Martin’s Restaurant,3,"So much potential in this meat and three but, alas, I was ultimately disappointed.  While their menu is expansive, they do a weird on / off day with certain items, but, at least from the tables, there is no way to tell what they are offering on that particular day until the server comes.  When our waitress greeted us very shortly after we sat down, she immediately wanted to know our order - but I felt like I had to navigate a very complicated menu process in order to land on something close to what I wanted. I love a good mom and pop diner, but I feel like Martin's is lacking in cleanliness and streamlining of their menu that would really make it special."
Martin’s Restaurant,4,"This spot is most know for chicken! If you order the chicken breast, you get 2, and your veggie options. Chicken had a great flavor and moist. Wasn't very impressed by the other menu items. Wanted lemon meringue and they were out, along with some other items. Prices are good though!"
Martin’s Restaurant,2,"Stopped by for lunch. The service was fine but the food was iffy at best. Awfully small selection for a meat and three restaurant, and the food took forever. The main entrees were tiny and most of the sides were cold and tasted like they were from a can. The staff was kind, but I wouldn't recommend anything other than a sweet tea."
Martin’s Restaurant,5,The best fried chicken I've ever had.  The best lemon pie I've ever had.  New dishes and menu everyday.  Love the hospitality and feel.  What a great place.  Just plain excellent.
Martin’s Restaurant,5,This place never disappoints.  A must if passing thru Montgomery as I was.  Best fried chicken around awesome cornbread and wonderful sweet tea !!!
Martin’s Restaurant,5,"After months of reading their awesome reviews, I finally tried Martin's Restaurant & I was pleased with everything from the service to the food. I ordered the meat & 3 w/ fried chicken, mashed potatoes & gravy, and fried okra (not pictured). My only complaint is that my chicken came out luke warm (which I fault no one for; I didn't expect it to be cooked to order seeing how much chicken they sell) but my server fixed that issue by promptly bringing me two fresh pieces. My little brother had the meat & 3 as well w/ fried chicken, mashed potatoes, & fried okra (2x). His only complaint is that he couldn't get another plate of food."
Martin’s Restaurant,5,"No better Chicken to be found! Love all the sides, especially the greens and the parodies salad! Cornbread is to die for!"
Island Delight at Dexter,5,"Excellent Authentic food from the ""yard""!Great flavors and spices. From the time you walk in, you know Jamaican food is being cooked. I can see the culture from outside the restaurant. Great vegan options!I had the vegan pepper steak and the veggies were flavored to perfection; I fishless cakes has a very tasteful flavor. The vegan curry is my favorite vegan option. They also have cállalo.Parking can get full fast. So you may have to park across the street.I'll be back!"
Island Delight at Dexter,1,"Update: I was in the area and decided to visit Island Delight because of my previous experience. Well we should have kept going. First, it took the waitress forever to take our drink orders. Second, my fiancé tried to order one of the juices and the waitress said that only a few could be made because no one knew how to make the others. Third, it took us 30 minutes to get those cups of water we ordered. Fourth, there was a big in the salt shaker. Fifth, once we finally ordered the waitress said they didn't have oxtails. We waited a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes without receiving food. Finally my fiancé and I had enough and left. The service was terrible."
Island Delight at Dexter,4,This is a great spot to quench your taste buds for Caribbean food..We were looking for a place that had a vegan and/or vegetarian option... My husband tried The vegan curry goat with rice and cabbage and said it was really good... I tried the Escoveitch Fish that wAs prepares fresh to order.. and it did not disappoint...The spice and flavor were perfect.. The beef meat pies were another treat.. The food were good portions and tasted great..
Island Delight at Dexter,5,"First time coming to this location and I was pleasantly surprised! I love the other location, but this is very nice and they have an extended menu the original location doesn't have. I tried a smoothie and it was ok, but my husband loved it. I tried to go super healthy but I should have gotten one of the fruit smoothies. I also got the peach tea, which is really good! I ordered the oxtails and they were great. I'd definitely come here again if I was going out with friends or wanted to explore downtown after eating."
Island Delight at Dexter,4,So impressed with this place which is great since I didn't expect it. I love a good surprise. I had the goat curry with greens and plantains. The goat was done so well with a great portion size for a lunch portion. You only get 2 plantains which is slightly disproportionate to the greens and rice but that's just a slight criticism. The plantains should be fried a lil longer because it seemed slightly undercooked.
Island Delight at Dexter,5,"When my sister worked at Maxwell AFB, she had mentioned Island Delight was incredible, transcending most places in Alabama. I happened to have business around there and learned the hard way that the original location was closed...so I drive on over to downtown to dine.The food here was absolutely worth the detour - I feel bad for the folks at Maxwell who can't just pop by for a quick meal now! I ordered the oxtails, which came with plantains, and man...so satisfying. I picked greens and rice & beans as my sides, and everything together in one bite was dynamite. Sweet, salty, textural, fabulous!I also immensely appreciate offering vegan options, which can be hard to find in the South, much less the islands. I periodically dine veg, so it's great to have those options readily available.Definitely worth stopping by for an excellent meal in Montgomery!"
Island Delight at Dexter,5,"Wow. I definitely wasn't expecting awesome Jamaican food in Montgomery!The restaurant is very colorful, and has good tunes echoing through out. The wait staff was attentive and pleasant to talk with. I went simple, Jammin' jerk chicken (all dark meat) with plantains and collard greens.  Defiantly the right choice. The chicken was perfect, and seasoned very well with jerk sauce on the side. The greens also well cooked, and just the right amount of salt.  The plantains add the right about of sweetness to balance the savoriness of both the chicken and greens.I have a couple more days in the area and returning is high on my list."
Island Delight at Dexter,4,"Authentic Carribean Flavors in downtown Montgomery. Very professional service and timely delivery of food. Curry goat was a little salty but otherwise very tasty food. There is a limited variety of ethnic cuisine in Montgomery and so this was a delight! We will be back, thank you Island Delight!"
Island Delight at Dexter,3,"This place is A-OK, but Savanna's nearby has much better jerk chicken and jollof rice. The food I had here was decent. The oxtail was really good, but the rice and sides left more to be desired. The curry chicken was sort of dry, and my other co-workers who got the red snapper said they could tell the fish was frozen and wasn't very fresh. It's one of the few things open later in downtown Montgomery, so it's one of the better options, but if Savanna's is open, that's definitely the better place to go."
Island Delight at Dexter,5,"This place is awesome. My brother and I had lunch here. It was my first visit. The place is very clean. It had a 98 health department score and I never seen so many servers cleaning as they took care of their customers. We had oxtails and rice. Very good flavor, and good presentation.  I'll definitely come back on my return trips to the Capital City."
Island Delight at Dexter,1,The food was dry and we had the worst service from Kelly. We had to flag out another waitress to bring our drinks and food.
Island Delight at Dexter,5,"Loveeeee this place. The food is absolutely delicious. The wait staff is professional and friendly. I highly recommend the smoothies, curried goat, and plantains. I've been several times already."
Island Delight at Dexter,5,"Once again, super friendly staff. We arrived around 3:44pm and they closed at 4pm, but they still let us order and dine in as a group of 5. We did not leave until around 5pm and they were not rushing us out. Our server was very kind and upbeat. Everyone enjoyed their smoothies and meals. I would go back again and again If I was local. I thoroughly enjoyed my jerk chicken plate."
Island Delight at Dexter,5,The Vegan Menu is not posted in the Regular Menu.  The Vegan Menu is on cards are are sitting at each table.  We enjoyed the items that were available on the day we were there. Vegan Burger was good.  The restaurant does not have mustard.   Everyone who got the Vegan Goat Curry was satisfied with taste and flavor.  Vegetable Fritters were a great way to start our meal.
Island Delight at Dexter,5,"I have yet to try anything on their menu that I do not like.  Great establishment and by far reaches the best authentic Jamaican restaurant in Montgomery, AL.  Wait, they are the ONLY authentic Jamaican restaurant in Montgomery!! My bad!!"
Island Delight at Dexter,5,"Great venue! It was clean, the environment and theme was very appropriate. The music was great, the waitresses and cashier were helpful. I asked for recommendations and the young lady was very helpful. The food was beyond amazing!! I definitely recommend this place and I plan to try more items as it was just overall a great experience."
Island Delight at Dexter,5,"While visiting Montgomery a great place to visit for lunch the service was excellent and the food was even better is it the park nearby and walk around,Be sure to visit the Rosa Parks statue and museum"
Island Delight at Dexter,4,"Great decor. Good service. Limited operating hours so check before you come. I came on a Saturday and they had a ""Saturday menu"" which was limited. I had the curried goat which comes with 2 sides. I chose the cabbage and plantains. Everything was good. I'll have to come back on a weekday so I can try things from the regular menu."
Island Delight at Dexter,5,"We to the Dexter location for dinner! There was a nice crowd but easy to find a table. There was one server, but she was definitely working hard and serving all the tables. I ordered a chicken patty for an appetizer. Then curry chicken with rice and beans, cabbage, and plantains. Some one I was with ordered beef oxtails, rice and beans, macaroni and cheese, and collard greens. The food came within ten minutes and was plentiful and delicious! The food is affordable as well. My order of the curry chicken dinner and appetizer was $12 including tax!  I love the restaurant decor and the location is great for going on a stroll after eating! I shall return soon!"
Island Delight at Dexter,4,"During my visit while in Montgomery we were in search of good food as always and Island Delight at Dexter popped up. I love jamaican food both in Jamaica and when I find a decent place in the States. I was excited about trying this spot out. Our first time on a Saturday trying to try this spot out the hours on Yelp said open till 10:00pm but when we showed up at 9:30pm they were already closed so that was disappointing. There isn't a whole bunch of restaurants to choose from in the area especially if you eat healthy and don't eat meat so we tried again on a Wednesday at around 7pm. The outside appearance of the restaurant is colorful and very inviting there were a couple of tables for outside dining, it made me feel like I was in Jamaica till I looked back and remembered I was in Alabama. The inside of the restaurant was nice as well, very bright and comfortable. We planned on getting our food to go so we went straight to the counter and took a seat while we browsed the menu. The customer service was a little shakey. There were several people who worked there behind the counter going back and forth but no one spoke to us till about 10 minutes after we sat down and she was the only one that had not seen us sitting there. I'm not sure if the one young lady who takes the orders is the only one designated to speak to customers but if I wasn't so hungry I would have left. There were several options to choose from on the menu including vegetarian which was impressive especially for Alabama.  I'm a pescatarian so there were several items for me to choose from. My boyfriend went with the Jerk Chicken, rice and peas, cabbage and collard greens. He liked the Jerk Chicken the sauce came on the side and it was sweet and kinda spicy which is not what we are used to   but the flavor was good just wasn't expecting it to be so sweet. He said the collard greens were spicy and flavorful and the cabbage was just ok. I chose the Brown Stew with snapper filet, rice and peas, cabbage and mac and cheese. The stew sauce was sweet kinda like the jerk sauce but not spicy at all and not what I'm used to. I enjoyed my meal it could have used more sauce and not been as sweet but I guess that's their thing here.  The rice and peas were cooked well, the cabbage was decent  but the mac and cheese was Delicious they deserve 5 stars alone for that. They have a juice bar which is a nice added touch. If you are in the area and want fresh tasty food with healthy options this is the spot to come to."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,5,"Omg I died and went to Cajun fried heaven! This place is fantastic , every dish at our table was amazing . We started with the Boudin Balls that come with a horseradish dip, perfect! The Boom Boom Shrimp did not last either! I got the Voodoo Shrimp and Grits, oh my,  they were slap your momma not once but twice good! The perfect bland of sweet corn grits with creepy bacon wrapped shrimp in a chili sauce.  I licked the plate clean which is saying a lot since I normally nibble and eat like a mouse. The food baby was worth it. My date got the Louisiana Combo he loved it too. It had fried shrimp, perfectly seasoned catfish and sweet yummy hush puppies. We also tried the Crawfish Atchafalaya and the Stuffed Burger (careful it's messy) and raved about that too. Don't hesitate, don't think twice, run over and have a feast at Walk-On. Your belly with thank you."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,4,"This was my second visit.This time around I had Voodoo shrimp and grits.  Overall, the shrimp was good, wrapped in bacon and jalapeno.  The grits, not so much.  The taste was okay, but the grits were a bit dry for my taste.I also had shrimp and corn bisque.  Very good. Portions were large.  I had a seltzer water and lemon and wait staff were attentive.My wife had a HUGE Chicken Berry Pecan salad that was delicious and easy enough for two.  Had strawberries and black berries, with a raspberry vinaigrette.  We may split one our next trip, and probably will have some left over.Passed on dessert, as we were full as a tick.Front of house and rest rooms were clean and well maintained.9/10. Will go again soon"
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,4,"I was very surprised and balky to see some new establishments in Montgomery, as I was on vacation visiting family. I decided to try this place out due to it being a sports bar and football games were on‍. My kids and I went and we enjoyed ourselves. They had a couple basketball shooting games which the kids enjoyed a lot while we waited for our seating. The kids had ordered cheeseburgers with fries and they enjoyed their meals, I had ordered some appetizers, fried cream cheese, with bacon and shrimp, and also fried gator bites. The appetizers were decent but I probably won't order them again, as for my entree I ordered the shrimp pho boy with bang bang sauce and fries. That was one of the best po boys that I've ever had. The atmosphere is great, from the games for the kids and adults, the TVs everywhere and just the overs set up. Their menu is pretty decent, I would definitely come back when I'm back in town."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,4,"So there has been much hype around this place so it was a must I go! When we arrived we were greeted and sat pretty quickly. Our server Ashley was very attentive, friendly, and efficient. However, our fries arrived cold, then warm, before finally arriving fresh and hot! We both ordered the Catfish platter although instead of fries I ordered the Corn Grits, which were very tasty. I just wish they were hot! On a good note.... The Strapless cocktail is soooo delish!!! I had two! All in all, the food didn't live up to the hype. It was good just not great and most of our food was warm at best! For $80 for two people, we expected more."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,2,"Food was ok.. If you're going here for drinks, think twice.  You can get lousy, terrible drinks and won't be allowed  to return or switch them out...We ordeered two top shelf margaritas and they tasted like a syrup  and sweet&sour.. it was horrible...so basically no matter how horrible or inexperienced the bartender is your you pay for it. We ordered a veggie burger and fried pickles which were ok.. The fried pickles where greasy... We then decided to try the beer tap, which was a better choice and good.."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,4,"I came to Walk-On's because it was recommended to me from someone at the mall. They mentioned they had a ton of options and that this place wouldn't disappoint. To my surprise the food is pretty good. There are a host of options to choose from! I was torn between the California club, the catfish or the turkey burger. I went with the turkey burger and it was really good. I hadn't had a burger in forever! It came with smoked Gouda and bacon which I loved and waffle fries! I forgot to mention I also tried the spinach dip that come with bread or chips (I tried both). The bread that the dip comes with is good but really hard. The dip in my opinion wasn't that good. I've had better. They also are running a special on bloody Mary's and mimosaS for just $3! Can't beat it! :) My waitress was great! Excellent customer service! I will certainly come back and try something else."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,5,"I had a fantastic experience at Walk Ons! My mom and daughter had been wanting to try it so we went for a late lunch. We were greeted immediately by the friendly staff and told it would be about a 10 minute wait. No problem, my daughter and I went to play the free throw basketball game while we waited and worked up an appetite. It was fun! The claw game is also in there to help you pass the time while you're waiting for a table. I also looked around the restaurant..it's pretty big with lots of football/college team decor so I can imagine this place is going to be packed during football season. Plus they have a beer tap right at your table! I've never seen that. The restaurant was clean and our server was wonderful. I had the Cajun pasta, my daughter had the crawfish two ways, and my mom had the steak and shrimp. We all loved everything! Prepared nicely and the Cajun seasoning was perfect. For dessert, I had the Krispy Kreme bread pudding and all I can say is wow! I'm not even a fan of bread pudding but I would eat this everyday of my life!!! Thank you walkons for a delicious experience. We will be back!"
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,4,I really enjoy this place. We were in town for a training and it was right across the street from our hotel. We walked over several times during the two weeks that we were there. The food is Louisiana style but not super spicy. There are many many many TVs and lots of sports on. Everyone seemed really nice. The Louisiana combo is a great deal and lots of food. I would recommend that an ice cold beer.
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,4,"This was probably our 6th time to Walk Ons. Madison was our waitress. She took very good care of us. I love the VooDoo Shrimp and Grits. Today I tried something new, the Blackened Fish Tacos. Very good!  We have also tried many of their burgers and sandwiches. Always large portions and tasty. Highly recommended."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,3,"I realize they are newly opened, but the bar staff needs more customer service training.  I was ignored for a long time as I got to listen to the bar staff laugh it up with other customers.  Food is good, though.  The dining room wait staff seems to do a good job."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,1,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I usually enjoy Walk-Ons. I'm going to give this location the benefit of the doubt since it is a new location. I actually came in more so to watch my fave NFL team than I did for food today. However, I didn't immediately order, because my game was not displayed on any of the 40 or so TVs in the restaurant. I asked some one at the bar could they display the game and they said ""Sure!"" Fifteen minutes later, someone came up and said to me ""I reminded her to change the channel."" As I'm writing this, I'm still waiting. I'm actually giving up and headed to some other sports bar. This place is is just as much about the experience as it is food. This particular experience was spectacularly underwhelming. I will give them another shot sometime in the future."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,1,"Way of priced draft beer. Almost double  what you can get at other sports bars down the street. Was hoping this would be a regular spot. Have not been back since opening week. 3-3-2020 figured I would try again since it sooo close to home!!!! Beer still double the price of other local national chains. Boom Boom shrimp was good. Almost never a full parking lot now that they have been exposed. Must only be looking for the business traveler's $$$. $28.10 for 1 Tall beer and starter + tip.At local national chain 3 large beers, same flavor, and appetizer $40. If I had come to this establishment 1st would have been even less. Missed most of happy hour."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,1,"This was our third trip to Walk-Ons.  The first time we ignored the bad reviews about slow service and issues with food and decided to give them a try because they were new.   The service was slow but the food was pretty good and the staff was friendly.  The second time the service was slow but again the servers were friendly and on this trip, we fell in love with the ribeye and catfish poboys.  Today was the third trip.  My son came into town and we were craving the poboys so we brought him to Walk-Ons.  We were told there was a twenty-minute wait but it was only four minutes so we thought this is great, they must have worked out all their kinks.  Sadly they have not.  Our server took our drink order and disappeared and another server came and asked our drink order.  We finally got drinks but nobody took our order for another 20 minutes.  Our server was absent for most of our visit, while another server tried to make up for her slack and inattention.  Our food took forever to come out.  That is some of our food did.  I never got mine.  After finally seeing our server and asking about it she looked surprised and went off to check on it.  After a while,  the server filling in for her came by and asked how we were and we told her I still didn't have my food.  She then went to check on it.  We were finally told that the kitchen had to cook a ""whole new batch"" of catfish.  No explanation was given why a whole new batch had to be cooked or anything.  A manager never came around to address the issue or apologize or anything.  This is what I feel probably happened.  I feel our server forgot to put my order in.  When she realized it (after we asked about it), she went and put it in and didn't inform a manager so the kitchen didn't know to expedite it ahead of what was currently in the queue  so my order went to the back of the line.  After being there for over an hour we told our server to forget about mine.  She then turned around and yelled past several tables to the server that had been helping her out that we didn't want it anymore, that we wanted to cancel our order.  Other patrons looked at us like we were trouble makers.  By this time my son and fiance had finished eating.  I had eaten part of my fiance's ribeye poboy, which was nothing like it was on our prior visit.  This time it had hardly any meat on it whereas before it was piled on.   Basically, I ate some bun with garlic aioli on it thinking my food would come any minute.  We asked for the check because had to leave.  My son had limited time to spend with us because he had to get back on the road and we also had to get back to our elderly mother who we had left home alone for a ""quick"" lunch out.    As soon as we were given our check we were rushed out the door.  They literally took everything off our table including my water which I intended to drink some before heading out the door.  Where was all this attention and rush while we were waiting for service?  Our bill was over a hundred dollars after tip and I left disappointed and hungry.  I realized after leaving that we had paid for one more drink than we ordered.  Just to be thorough, the other food that we received was as follows:  The chicken avocado sandwich my son ordered was great, they even subbed the bread for the brioche bun he asked for however, his sweet potato fries were cold and old.  The onion rings that came with the ribeye poboy were droopy and greasy.  The alligator bites were inconsistent, some pieces were great while others were chewy with, I don't know how to explain it except to describe it as sinewy.  The guys liked the alligator bites, I couldn't get past the texture so I didn't eat them."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,1,I saw that the Montgomery location was offering Grower fills to go during Coronavirus. Sen't my friend by to fill my growler. They obviously didn't sanitize the growler and reused the old cap! The beer was flat and stale. Complete waste of money and time. Never again!
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,5,If you like sports bars and awesome burgers with a Cajun flair then you really need to check out Walk-On's. They have an awesome selection oof beers on tap. TVs are everywhere so you won't miss the big game and they are very  family friendly. On my visit I had the double bacon cheeseburger and onion rings wIth boudin balls as an appetizer and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,2,Poor customer service. Had several people standing around but only one guy (Tyler) actually working. Food was ok not great. My mahi with crawfish mushroom sauce had 1 crawfish in it.
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,5,Great environment and great customer service!! I also like their play book for drink selections. Boom/ Boom Shrimps are a hit!!
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,1,"While walking to the table the host was hitting other chairs, where customers were sitting with high chair so I offered to carry it for her. We were seated in the very back corner because we have kids (understandable). We sat in the restaurant for 15 without being greeted or any drink order taken. Several servers looked at us, too, but chose to act like we were invisible. So, we decided to leave after 20 mIn. We walked out of the restaurant and 4 servers were up at the front talking to  each other and didn't bother to say a goodbye greeting. VERY DISSATISFIED."
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,4,"Staff always friendly! Enough televisions to suit everyone plus a broad menu for all. Pro tip: ask for tortilla chips with the spinach artichoke dip. Tonight the ""toast points"" that came with it tasted more like stale French bread. Delish with the light, perfectly crispy chips! Tonight I'm having he shrimp poor boy with boom boom sauce, quite good!"
Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux,4,My boss treated us for lunch today! The service was quick and the food tasted amazing. I got the burger and the bun was so fresh. I tried the sweet potato fries for the first time and they were yummy.
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,"My wife and I found this gem on yelp and decided to give it a try. All I can say is WOW! I had the one hot mess and she had the burger with Thai buffalo sauce. They were both absolutely fantastic. The fries were also great. If you are a fan of a craft burger or are in the mood to branch out, give this place a try. Cool guys in there that told us about the menu, as well as a cool atmosphere. I would definitely go back!"
5 Points Deli & Grill,3,"Bad first impressions: Place is located around the side of a strip of businesses. Had to make a u turn to locate. When we walked in the guy eating at the counter was more interested in us than the guy behind the counter. No greeting just hunched over order pad with pen. We checked the menu before coming so we knew what some of the cryptic names on the chalkboard meant. ""the bob"" and ""killer bs"" burger gotta check the paper menu for explanations. Asked what kind of slaw it was the guy said ""regular slaw"". Mayonnaise kind? ""Yeah"". (It was not. It was a vinegar based slaw and neither of us cared for it.) The good: Beers on tap (although I couldn't partake this time). Burger was good although lots of mayo (normally get on side) fries were thick and home style, very good. Extensive menu on chalkboard when you walk in. Needs improvement: Roast beef sandwich wasn't great. Horseradish advertised wasn't evident also lots of mayo. Self serve drink station was fine. tea was very watery. We picked it bc of good reviews and close to interstate. Lots of potential here but didn't have a great experience."
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,"Yum!  Let's start there. My husband and I were on a mini road trip in the Montgomery area and used Yelp to find a delish lunch spot. We ended up at 5 Points Deli & Grill and we were not disappointed.  Between the two of us we had a Ziggy sandwich (ham, pork, pickles, spicy mustard) and a burger with bacon and jalapeños along with fries and a piece of caramel pie. They cook the burgers between medium to medium well unless you ask for something else. I did ask for my burger to be more between medium well to well. It came out closer to well and that was just right for me. The burger itself was very tasty and the toppings pushed it over the top into fantastic. The fries were great, on the salty side, but great. The pie tasted like eating a caramel apple without that pesky apple!  If you're in the area, give this place a try for sure."
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,Hey... Look....You can eat at the BK or Micky D's or the Hot and Juicy place that has a lil red headed girl with pig tails... But.... This joint has the goods! Fantastic food... Cool atmosphere and a burger so good you'll lick your eyebrows! Do yourself a favor... Get out of the burger rut and have a good experience... I dare you!
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,Amazing burgers and sandwiches. Variety was so good I went two days in a row when in town.
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,"This should be the place you go to in order to get the best burger you have ever tasted.  I enjoyed the ""Killer B's"".  I have traveled throughout the US and can tell you I have never had a burger this good.  You could taste the flavor the whole time.  Every bite leaves you wanting more.  It is kind of small little place, making it hard to find parking.  Don't let that stop you from enjoying this paradise."
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,What a heck of a bacon cheeseburger. Great staff and awesome food. A little hard to find on the gps but don't give up. Ask the guys what's their best burger and go for it. They are large portions so u can share of ur not that hungry. Sweet team is on point and the fries are great. Add an extra topping to the burger and have at it
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,"We walked in to a pretty busy little deli. Exposed brick with a tin tile ceiling and old hardwood floors. The place looked clean and fun. They have local artists' paintings on the walls.  There was smoke in the air from their meat smoker. Cool place. But the menu on the chalk wall  was a bit confusing- it included names like ""Classic BLT"" and ""Ham and Swiss,"" and other names where you know what you're getting.  But there were others like ""The Mighty Casey,"" ""One Hot Mess"" and ""The Ziggy.""  I passed on the ""What the Heck Am I Ordering?"" It was a bit embarrassing, because I wanted something different and delicious, and punted for a Club Sandwich due to the  little line behind me while I tried to figure out what a ""PS I love you"" was (pastrami, If you wonder). We ordered to go, told them we were in a hurry, and took a seat. 25 minutes later, we finally went up to complain/cancel and leave. We were greeted by the guy who apparently owns the place. He was all smiles and asked proudly how we enjoyed our meal. I popped his balloon with a snarky, ""Don't know...been waiting for 25 minutes and we need to go.""  Our order was sitting behind him on the counter, where it had undoubtedly sat for a while. He was mortified. And very apologetic.  For that reason and the one that follows, 5 stars. It was clearly a human error, and he took full responsibility. I grumbled to my wife that it would be cold.  It was in an insulated to go box. So... reason 2- the food was very tasty. The fries were dusted with salt and seasoning. Great!  The club was piled high with turkey, bacon, smoked meats, fresh onion, etc.  It was more meat than bread and cut in half instead of quarters so I could actually hold it. It was delicious. My bride had a salad with smoked pork, which I helped her finish as well- awesome. It's a great little joint with fresh, piled up food. I hope this place succeeds wildly.  (Only suggestion- more menu signs with brief descriptions.  I don't like guessing what I'm ordering.)"
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,"I've had a couple different burgers from here. They're always top notch. I definitely recommend 5 Points to anyone, especially people looking for a great burger. This is the best burger in Montgomery, and they have a ton of different and unique burgers to choose from."
5 Points Deli & Grill,3,"Was in town for a football game and found this place on Yelp. It was close to the stadium so we decided to try it out. The service was nice, the food was good and the place had a nice appeal and was clean. The thing that kept this from being a 5 rating was the presence of ants in the Orange soda fountain drink which was treated as normal by the staff. That's definitely not normal at any restaurant that I've ever eaten at! Having spent $30 in this place I expected more than a blow off about the drink! A refund would have been nice!"
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,I am so glad we happened upon this spot after a basketball game at ASU.  Oh my!!!   The burger was to die for!  Juicy and big!   Fries delicious as well.  And homemade desserts!   Does it get better?  Yes bc it's affordable!   I will be back.  Not even too far off I-65!   Be sure to make effort to try it!   And they have good crushed ice too!!!!
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,"Had their One HOT Mess (pimento cheese, bacon, jalapenos) burger with fries. Burger was out of this world! (If you're lactose intolerant, DO NOT eat this lol) The fries were seasoned and cooked to perfection. Very quick service, and very kind service. Will definitely go back when I'm not counting calories lol"
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,"Came here for lunch after it being recommended to us by a friend. It was fairly busy when we arrived, but had emptied by the time we finished eating. They've got a large chalkboard wall with the menu on it, but I recommend looking at the printed menus since those have descriptions for the sandwiches and burgers. My husband ordered the Grilled Cheese Cheeseburger with fries and I got the Hawaii Five-O with fries. I had them leave the jalapeño slices and sriracha off of mine. My husband added bacon to his. The fries were great. Crispy and golden with soft insides. Nice crunch when you bit into them. They had homemade ranch that was also very good. Both of our burgers were fantastic. The grilled cheese cheeseburger was huge. The Hawaii Five-O wasn't as big, but was still too much for me to finish. Everything tasted great and fresh. The patties were cooked nicely and had the right amount of char on them (they didn't taste burnt though). The bun on my burger managed to stay together even though it was a large burger. Great burgers, great ingredients, cool vibe, and good service. We will definitely be back and will be exploring the menu more!"
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,These guys love their burgers and it shows. Five stars for 5 Points! I had the pastrami and Swiss burger and it was excellent.
5 Points Deli & Grill,4,"Ordered the quesadilla burger and the pastrami sandwich. Both were delicious. Especially the burger. Big burger, flavorful and made for two meals. Can't wait to try other burgers. Pasta salad side was very good. Fries were OK. Overall would definitely recommend."
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,"I had a meeting in the area and decided to stop by, I ordered a Club to-go. The place was still buzzing around 1pm and I was ""hangry"" so the 25min I waited was agonizing... BUT It was beyond worth the wait. I understand things can be crazy in the kitchen after a lunch rush, there were also a good number of people in the tiny spot. If you're in a rush- call ahead. If you don't mind hitting up one of Montgomery's newest lunch spots during lunchtime, I promise it's worth the wait!!"
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,"great little dive place. am in town just for a couple days and took a chance to drive out here. very glad I did. immediate area is kind of sketchy but it's surrounded by a nice residential area. there's not much parking right by it, but inside is nice. had the wonderful grilled cheese cheeseburger (with bacon) where the top and bottom bun are each replaced with a grilled cheese sandwich. it's just as decadent and artery-clogging as it sounds. but super tasty. burger is juicy, fries are very good. it was so huge and filling, I couldn't eat the whole thing."
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,I got the pastrami and Swiss and the folks I was with got burgers. My sandwich was great and everyone's burger looked fantastic too. Definitely a place worth checking out.
5 Points Deli & Grill,1,"Wow, bad food all around. Ordered from a delivery service, got cold stale fries, undercooked meat, slaw that tasted Kimchee. Had a sick stomach all afternoon. Do not recommend!"
5 Points Deli & Grill,5,Excellent burgers and fries; generous portions. Try the One Hot Mess! The homemade honey mustard and banana pudding were also a hit with our crew.
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,5,"I love the food here! To me this is the most authentic Thai cuisine in Montgomery. Unlike some places, their dishes are true to the Thai/Loation style and haven't been Americanized. The Green Papaya Salad- Thai style & hot- is my favorite. I have NEVER been disappointed and this is a restaurant that cares about their customers."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,3,"Filling portions.  I was told by the waiter that they make their own spice combo for the curry.  I had the red curry and it packed a flavorful bite.  It is homestyle cooking with rough chopped veggies. The noodle dish, Pad Woo Sen, was a bit sweeter than I would like.The interior decor is dated and they could polish the facilities to make it more wholesome."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,2,The service was fast because there was very few people when I went there. I ordered a penang curry. The food was blah. The chicken seems like it was reheated (hard and cold). It was terrible in my opinion. Place can get an upgrade for a better atmosphere.
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,3,"I've wanted to like Green Papaya, I really have.  I've eaten there several times over the past few years but they persist in using MSG, which I am highly reactive to.If they ever learn. To prepare food sans that flavor ""enhancer"" I will eat there a great deal, as I like Thai food.Edit:  I went by Green Papaya again and tried a dish without any heat and had no issues as I normally get with MSG.  The meal was good.  I certainly would not have an evening meal there, but for dinner it was great.6/10"
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,2,"Soup was okay but too salty.  Pad Thai was too sweet but plenty spicy at medium heat.  Egg roll was dry and tough.  Maybe it was because this was the lunch special and they could have been serving day old food.  Whatever the reason, it wasn't very good today."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,4,"For dinner, duck and chicken pad thai was great. Little pricey but you get what you pay for. Tip:  Lunch pad thai is half the price."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,2,"Much potential here, but my meal was disappointing. I ordered a chicken tom yum and a ginger shrimp stir-fry, and while the tom yum was decent, the stir-fry may have been the oiliest meal I've had in an Asian restaurant. Not only that, but I've ordered Thai ginger stir-fry many times, and this version tasted very different. There were a lot of unexpected flavors here, to the extent the ginger didn't stand out.The one thing I did appreciate was the large serving size, with plentiful meat and vegetables."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,1,"Wow, horrible customer service. It is clear that the waitress here hates her job and hates customers."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,2,"I hadn't been in awhile and looked forward to lunch today. I was disappointed.  This place had the best Thai food in town IMHO, but today, the soup was cloudy and way too salty. The Kao Pad tasted 'off' and even the sweet tea was different, like something bought in a jug. As always the service itself was great, but the kitchen needs work."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,5,This place is great. I have had the Pad Thai every single time and have really enjoyed it. They have very quick and friendly service. The inside could be updated some but I have really enjoyed the times I have gone.
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,5,Had the Tom ka soup and the pad kee mao. Both were excellent. The service was great and food came out fast.
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,2,"(I've dined in Guam, Hawaii, all over Cali. So I'm basing my reviews from what I've come come to know as what they're supposed to taste like)First time eating at any Thai place in Alabama. First walked in with an unwelcoming greeter. But the waiter made up for it :)Chicken Panang curry - chicken was more to the dry side and had more veggies than chicken. Chicken pad Thai - just ok. Not what I'm used to.Egg drop soup - kids ordered and they said it was really good that they wanted to order a second. Was denied because we had ordered a lot already.Tom Kha - when the cup of soup arrived, I was initially off put by the sight of what was in it. Never have I been served a Tom ___ soup with broccoli and mushrooms... Maybe a little bit but this was the main attraction to the soup. Again, off putting. But one taste of the soup changed my mind. It was delicious. My daughter took all my shrimp so I was left with broccoli and mushrooms lolChicken Kao Pad - I would recommend trying this. It may be my most fav out of all we had ordered, along with some Tom Kha :)Saved the worst for last.Beef Pad se Ew - it's like it was a totally different dish from what I'm used to. Even the noodles weren't the thick flat ones that u get elsewhere. The taste is different. Not like the usual pad se ew that I've tried abroad. That wasn't the most disappointing part of the noodles, but I'll get back to that in a bit.As we were leaving my husband asked what I thought about the place. If I would ever come back. It heights that came to mind right away was ""I really enjoyed the Kao pad and the Tom Kha... But...."" Then I answered ""I would like to experiment other Thai places to see what else is out there"".Seriously, what really matters in a Thai joint is the pad Thai and the Panang curry. So... We shall try elsewhere !We obviously ordered too much (2 adults and 2 smal kids) so we brought it home.As I'm eating it for lunch the next day do I come upon the most unsettling thing. I'm almost done as I eat my pad se ew and the chicken Kao Pad when I  bite into something that made a CRUNCH.Now, I hardly ever swear especially in front of my kids but that happened. I spit out whatever was in my mouth into a clear side of my plate. Bite again and still CRUNCH. I try to spit whatever out and out comes 3 pieces. Of what seems to be... What is this? GLASS. How upsetting! It's a Sunday so I can't call in to make a complaint. We really should've sent the dish back once we all agreed we didn't like the dish. Maybe it would've saved us the trouble AND saved this place from a bad Yelp review. So after lunch, I've decided I wouldn't go back there after all. That we can search high and low for another Thai place OR just try and make it ourselves. Not the usual Thai food I'm used to. Had a different taste."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,5,"I placed my order over the phone and was told it would take about 10 minutes. I got there and it still wasn't ready. However, I can't complain because they were packed! It was during the normal lunch hour so I probably should've expected the longer wait. The food is REALLY good and you definitely get your money's worth. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai and it was enough to eat for both lunch and dinner."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,4,"While this place is decorated like a 1980's hotel most of the food is on point.  Understand that if you order something ""Thai Hot"" they are not playing around.  ""Thai Hot"" is another level of hot that many can't handle.  I wasn't super impressed with the tom yum soup or the fried spring rolls (no fresh available) but the Pad Thai and the duck curry were great; both were some of the best I've had.  I'll be back to get my Thai fix."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,5,Today was my first time visiting and I was impressed. The server was very knowledgeable with the menu and help me pick out a wonderful choice. The food came out hot and fresh and our glasses were never empty. I greatly enjoyed my meal.
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,5,"I don't know much about Thai food, but I was on a search for something different. This place came through like a champ! It is a little off the beaten path (nestled in a little strip mall). The atmosphere is unassuming, but clean, quiet and functional. The service was prompt, helpful, and fast. I ordered the Spring rolls, Basil rolls, and Pad Thai on medium heat. I thuroughly enjoyed the spring rolls. They were fresh out of the frier, hot, crispy, and very flavorful. The basil rolls were something completely new to me.  I didnt love them, but I suspect that was due to me never having them before and their authenticity. Then comes the Pad Thai. I had chicken and shrimp on medium heat. I have never had Pad Thai before, but this was delicious! I am pretty good about spicyness and the medium was perfect for me. I would be careful about going any higher. It was spicy and sweet and savory. They gave me a very generous portion; I will definitely be asking for a box when I leave. This place was a real treat, and I would recommend it to anyone."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,5,Wowzers. This place is so good. I got take out green curry chicken and beef pho and both were so bomb. I never thought you could actually have delicious pho but I brought this home and it was so delicious. Quite possibly the best pho broth I've ever had. Will definitely come back here for all my Thai (and pho) needs.
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,4,"So maybe this place needs a little updating, but I continue!I will say there were some items I didn't like too much. Like the treasure dish and the tom yum soup.  The soup was on the sweet side and the treasure dish, was just okay. The Basil fish, Pad Thai, and the green papaya salad were the best dishes we had. We ordered the green papaya salad, Thai hot and later changed that to hot. And thank goodness we did! My normal level of spice is pretty high, and the HOT matched my taste buds. It was more of a Lao style salad, as it had a stronger padek/anchovy flavor. I took a mini break before continuing. I have only ever had Pad Thai one time, other than at Mekong, that I thoroughly enjoyed. It was a little oily, but definitely had all the authentic flavors I look for in Pad Thai. You can taste the high heat used from the wok. I wish I had more. And FINALLY, I love Thai basil. The Thai Basil Fish was almost as good as the Pad Thai. Mom mentioned that it was a little heavy handed with the salt. Overall, would definitely come back for lunch/dinner. Only for my fave trio."
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,5,5 stars just for their Papaya Salad Lao Traditional Style. Otherwise the other foods is average.
Green Papaya Lao & Thai Cuisine,5,"The food and service was great. Seating can be an issue during lunch hour, but that has never stopped me from going. The Pad Thai is their most popular dish and once you try it, you'll know why."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,5,It's simple as this. The name comes from this scenario. Friend 1: Where you eating tonight? Friend 2: Joe's Friend 1: you going to Joe's again?Joe's again wings did not disappoint! Do yourself a favor and get the Joe's sauce. I need to try the burger bc it is the rave of the town. All in all Joe's is the go to for wings.
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,4,"Good food, great employees! The ribs are HUGE and full of flavor, a little fatty. The hush puppies are perfectly breaded and fried okra was the right about if crisp. Pals had pulled pork and said a little salty."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,5,"There are people who seek out the best burgers in every city, town and crossroads they pass, eager to search and willing to pay anything for the transcendent burger. I admire these people, and will allow that some may have found a handful of more remarkable examples than the Joe's Cheeseburger. Even I, a mere student of the art, recall a worthy rival from a dozen or so years ago. It was made with Wagyu beef, foie gras, heirloom tomatoes, organic micro greens, carmelized onions with chef's aioli on house baked brioche, and it cost $29. This is the best burger under $10 ($7.50 w fries, are you kidding me?) you'll ever have. Double patty, perfectly seasoned, charred and juice-sealed with middle bun, and in-house spicy hottish relish a la Big Mac in a perfect worldDon't worry if the parking lot looks a little sketchy, with cars parked at janky angles off the raggedy looking last exit before I-65 / I-85 split (from the south)- their crew is instafriendly, the night I passed through a young Montgomery cop just off duty was talking sports with the manager and if you're extra sensitive you can always get it to go, drive next door to the McDonald's parking lot and wipe the juice off your face while you laugh and laugh and laugh. Also, McDonald's has coffee if you need an excuse."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,5,Food menus ... One of the best place in the city ... A hidden gem of good southern foods ...
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,5,"I don't live in Montgomery so I don't know the good places to eat and wouldn't have gone here if not for the number of rave reviews in Yelp.  I am an adventurous eater.   I like trying new places and love finding good ""hole in the wall"" restaurants.  Joe's Again is definitely a hole in the wall.   It is also popular given my time there today. When you walk in the first impression is how small it is.   There are only 5 tables. The biggest will sit 3 people.  So most people come in and get their order to-go.  The woman at the counter is as friendly and welcoming as I have seen in a long time.   She just wanted to make everything right. I took two of my team with me.  I got the ribs,  another got a polish sausage dog,  the other got the Joe's burger.   Let's start with the burger.   First off, it was BIG.  If you're really hungry,  get this. The polish sausage was big as well.   Both guys said they would come back to this place.   My ribs were good but a little tougher than really good ribs should be.   The BBQ sauce seemed to be from a bottle.   Next time I will likely try the wings.   There will definitely be a next time. Joe's may not be in the best part of town.  But they are right of I-65.  If you don't stop here and try them out then you are missing out on some good cooking.  For me,  this is a come back restaurant!*Update* Well, I did come back and this time I ordered the wings. They are a good size with a good amount of meat on them.   There are lots of sauces to choose from.   I went with the Joe's sauce.  If he names it after himself then it must be special,  right?  It was medium-hot with a touch of smokiness to it.   Like most people who like spicy food,  I want a bite of heat, but not too much.   The Joe's sauce was near the top of my personal heat scale.I will order the wings again for my next visit.   But,  I will explore the various sauces to see if I can find a favorite. Finally,  the service from the cashier was just as good.   This lady has a genuinely generous heart and makes me like Joe's Again even more.  Great customer service isn't as common as it should be. Bonus Tip: The bathroom light switch is outside of the bathroom, opposite the door.   They like to turn off the light to save electricity."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,5,"It was mentioned before, don't let the bars on the window fool you. If you pass up this place, you've passed up great BBQ. Stopped in the first time, based on yelp ratings. My addition stops are because the food is awesome and the staff is very friendly. Don't miss this place.  I time my trips through Montgomery so I can stop here."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,4,Great service. Great food. Tight space but very nice people. Could have a better setup it works how it is.
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,5,"The best damn ribs I've ever at outside my own grill and backyard. They were amazing and hot. It was fresh and seasoned to perfection. This little spot is a gem right in the middle of the hood just like I like. When traveling I love to eat at local mom and pop restaurants and when I stumbled upon this one by accident I didn't regret it for one minute. The lady at the front was very pleasant, friendly and professional. The next time that I stop in Alabama I will be making a special trip just to get these ribs."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,1,"Ummm, I hate to be the bearer of bad news but my experience was very unimpressive, in lighter terms. You want honesty? Well here goes....the fried chicken was dry, bland and tasted (and appeared) as though it was leftovers from the previous day and dropped in the grease again to serve. If that isn't the case then it was just really bad chicken. Unseasoned, dry chicken is an abomination. I was told that the pound cake was homemade but it didn't taste homemade but rather store bought. The best tasting thing was the mac n cheese. On another note, the young man taking orders was very prompt and delivered friendly service. The restaraunt is very small inside and not ideal for dining in. I wanted to love this place based upon its reviews but it's a no for me . Complete waste of money here as I discarded majority of my food."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,4,Don't let the bars on the windows fool you.  This is serious Alabama bbq.  The ribs and wings are fantastic.
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,5,Great food and great pricing! It's in the hood but definitely work the travel! The inside of the venue is small but it looked like they had an extra room on the side. I'm not sure about the side room. Either way this is great food and it's cheap.
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,2,"While on a trip to Montgomery, my boyfriend and his cousin suggested this place because it was reasonable priced. I trusted their opinion because my boyfriend went to college here and his family is originally from here. His cousin currently still lives there. You would think I could trust their opinion right? Nope. First off, while calling in our order, the lady was trying to rush us off the phone like the place was packed and busy. We get there, the place was empty and it was only one customer waiting for his order. My boyfriend who usually got burgers from there decided to get fried whiting and grilled shrimp with baked bean and potato salad. I wanted something more healthy with some flavor so his cousin tells me their taco salad is good.The taco salad is nothing more than dried out and unseasoned ground beef on top of corn tortilla chips, big chunks of tomato and iceberg lettuce. They only give one small dressing cup of salsa and it didn't help combat the dryness. My boyfriend's food wasn't anything special either. The fish ok but the shrimp was unseasoned. They literally grilled it and put it in the box without any type of seasoning. The sides weren't amazing either. Didn't care for the potato salad and the beans tasted like they took them out of the can, put too much sugar in them, and added some ground beef to it. I'm surprised it wasn't better for all the hype it was given. I guess you can only get burgers if you come here."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,5,"Well hello sweet baby! My love and I embarked on a road trip and we chose this as our first stop. Probably the best first decision we could have made. This no nonsense location just off the freeway is a perfect stop. We chose to split ten hot wings with fries and a rib dinner with baked beans and Mac and cheese. The ribs had a killer smoke flavor that was really well balanced with a sweet, sticky sauce. The boyfriend doesn't even usually like this type of sauce but loved these. The wings were also a delight. However, coming up from behind to steal the show was those damn beans. I want beans like that every day. Bonus feature, we couldn't stop gushing about how perfect the food was so the man at the counter shared his personal stash of grilled BBQ wings with us. They were basically the thing church picnics are made of. No ragrets. Not even a letter."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,5,"Thanks to another reviewer: directions were easy to follow to find the place; I had insider knowledge about the light switch outside of the bathroom and was able to share that when someone wondered out loud about where it was; and the Joe's Sauce is everything and more. Leaves your lips tingling for more. I couldn't decide between the cheeseburger and wings but the young man working the counter suggested both and half them between myself and hubby, along with added onion rings-- made for the right portion of food! I got good-natured ribbing by a family member that came in about not being able to eat the burger by myself, and though I assured them that I could put away some food-- when it came out, I saw why (a double patty!) (Really glad we halved the portions of the meal!) They also have the good fries (crinkly-- perfect proportion of potato to crispiness); the sweet tea was the right sweetness (not diabetes-induced); and I really appreciated the hole-in-the-wall atmosphere. Also, a really good mixture of new customers and repeat! If you decide to call in your order, just be mindful that there is a 20 min wait. My hubby and I are passing by again on our return trip at the end of the weekend and he is eager to try the rib sandwich!"
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,4,"The place is small, but the food was great!  With the AF base so close, expect to wait a little bit for your food during lunch hour.  It was definitely worth the wait, but it was pretty cramped inside.  Would go again for dinner."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,4,"Woohoo! This place was awesome. Be forewarned that this place is TINY so it's probably not a good idea to come in groups bigger than 3. The employees were very helpful and the sweet when I had questions about the menu. I ordered the chopped BBQ sandwich with a side of mac to go.  My friends all ended up ordering the wings. I tried pretty much everyone's wings the honey Dijon, the Buffalo, the lemon pepper. All wings were to die for. They were perfectly sauced and crispy too. I highly recommend the wings. I liked the BBQ sandwich, it had a nice taste and the BBQ sauce was perfect but after having tried the wings I wish I would have ordered them. The meals were pretty decently priced and the place was backed on a Friday afternoon. My only complaint was the size of the restaurant, if it was larger I would have loved to to enjoy my meal fresh inside of the restaurant. If you are looking for a quick, high quality meal, for a decent price, I highly recommend stopping by!"
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,4,"This place is a little off putting to look at, but once you try the wings you will be in heaven. Wings are one of my top 3 favorite foods and this place nails them. I ordered the 10 honey mustard and 10 medium wings. I went with medium to be on the safe side, but they were more of a mild to me. In the future I will get a hot. Coincidentally, BBQ is also one of my top 3 favorite foods and they offer it here. I did not try it this time around, because I am very critical when it comes to BBQ; however, I after scoping it out from other people's orders, I think I will give it a shot when I go back. On top of the good food, the staff was extremely friendly and struck up small talk while you waited for your food. The restaurant is very small and I would not recommend eating in if you are there with more than two people. You would be much better off doing takeout."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,5,"We stopped here on a long car trip to get some quick lunch to go. The restaurant is conveniently located right off of the interstate. We came in the after the lunch rush and got our hot wings and fries very quickly. The food was absolutely delicious and cooked freshly. The wings were crispy, saucy, and very satisfying. The fries were cooked to perfection. We would absolutely stop here again."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,5,"Service was the friendliest, food was amazing, and it was so busy because the staff made you feel at home. We eat a lot of BBQ and I would say this is one of the best I have ever had. Great hole in the wall local's spot."
Joe’s Again Buffalo Wings & Rib City,4,"While visiting Montgomery I wanted to try some good down home southern cooking.   That is exactly what I got.   I was told to try the burger,  and my girl got the chicken wings.   Even though it was nothing that stood out about the food we ate,  it was defiantly delicious."
The Seafood Bistro,4,"Doesn't look like much as it is in a strip mall next to an exercise gym. Almost didn't go in but...glad we did! I had a grilled shrimp PO-boy that was overflowing with buttery succulent shrimp. I topped that off with Cajun corn (cob) that was bathed in butter and spices. Excellent and portions are hefty! Friendly service with waitress sincerely greeting us. Glad we stopped in and would recommend it. Only negative, they were out of their praline ice cream!"
The Seafood Bistro,3,I have ate here multiple times and the food has been good . However my most recent experience I found hair in my food ( I have a fade) and the rice wasn't the same for some reason but sometimes we have bad days .
The Seafood Bistro,3,"This was recommended by someone at the current facility I'm working at in Montgomery.  I came on a Tuesday,  so it was really lowkey and quiet. I was greeted at the door by the hostess and shown my seat; the waitress came over right away and took my drink and food order (I had already stalked the menu at work, so I knew what I wanted.). I ordered the seafood gumbo as an appetizer & the fried shrimp tacos.My food came really quickly,  so I ended up taking my seafood gumbo home. The shrimp on my tacos were HUGE!!!! The tacos were served with Spanish rice (which took my 4 stars to 3); it was cold and plus there was a lot of it with feta cheese sprinkled on top (definitely getting the potatoes next time).All in all,  good experience.  Wait staff was nice and attentive. I'm in Montgomery for 3 more weeks,  so I'll definitely be back."
The Seafood Bistro,5,I've only ever eaten one item here and it's so good that I've never tried anything else. Try the shrimp po'boy and you won't be disappointed. It has so many shrimp you'll have to eat several before you can even close it well enough to pick it up.
The Seafood Bistro,5,"This place has the best crab legs I've ever eaten!  You don't need melted butter with the sauce these legs come swimming in. If you don't like the sides, you can switch them out. People here are always super cool. This is a hidden gem."
The Seafood Bistro,5,"Ol this little place is a very good yummy Pot of Gold!! Everything we had here tasted oh so good!! Gator Po Boy , Tacos tasty Red beans n rice!! We're the bomb! Fried Okra very good. Sweet tea awesome, service was Great! Young man there very informative of the food great customer service! Got refills done quick didn't even have to ask!!! That's service"
The Seafood Bistro,5,First time having crab claws and they were to die for!  They had just the right amount of Cajun seasoning paired with their house aioli and oh my God amazing!I had fried mahi-mahi and popcorn shrimp - equally as delectable!This place is a must if you're ever in Montgomery!
The Seafood Bistro,4,Went to the seafood bistro on a Sunday.  I didn't know they closed at 4 and we arrived at 3:30.  However we wouldn't have known they were about to close because service was still quick and friendly.  I ordered the crawfish and gator with the Cajun potatoes and my husband ordered the 1/2 lbs shrimp boil bag.   My food tasted like it was fried a little to hard but still tasted very good.   The potatoes were amazing.  There was also a lot of food.  Too much to eat.  I ended up needing a Togo box.  My husband loved his.   He said next time he is getting the pound it was so good.  As I said before they were about to close when another family came in 10 min to 4.  They were still greeted politely and seated.  Over all the only complaint I had was the Cajun wasn't spicy enough and the cocktail sauce tasted like ketchup.   Regardless we will be going back.
The Seafood Bistro,4,"Had an doctor's appointment which had a waiting period,  so we decided to grab some brunch.  This spot at this time of the day was very quiet,  able to enjoy the sounds of the new Orleans music. Our server was very sweet . The food was amazing, usually whe I order wings from other establishments I ja e to send them back due to them being too hard. These were made just for me... my salad was oh so good....."
The Seafood Bistro,3,"I hate to be partial but seafood bistro is not New Orleans. I like the open floor plan layout, this would be a good place for a large group of friends together. we were sad immediately upon arrival a waitress was very friendly and attentive. Normally I go to the bathroom and check for cleanliness but forgot. I was excited to finally sit down and have lunch with my husband.And now for the reason I gave three stars. The food was overcooked my ouster's were fried extremely hard my okra was hard and the french fries were OK.  My husband decided to get shrimp and grits because you can't go bad with shrimp and grits unless they are way too salty. The shrimp did not take fresh and too much salt in the grits. If the grits were cooked without salt I believe it would've been much better, with cheese and salt added no go on the grits. I will go back and try this time I will ask for my oysters to be fried softer."
The Seafood Bistro,5,A friend suggested I try this location when I was on that side of town. My friend did not steer me wrong. Staff was great. I really like the restaurant's layout. Very clean and we'll kept. Food was VERY good. I had the lunch gumbo and dragon shrimp. Excellent. I will be back.
The Seafood Bistro,5,Awesome food. They provide so much food you always have leftover to take home. You must try the gumbo and the red beans and rice.
The Seafood Bistro,5,"Great Cajun food, I was very happy with the food, service was great, will definitely be coming back again."
The Seafood Bistro,5,Always a great experience. The shrimp tacos are a large portion and full of flavor (I get them blackened)! Seafood is fresh and there's a wide variety of options. A must in Montgomery!
The Seafood Bistro,1,"This was my FIRST TIME and LAST TIME here!!! I ordered the 2 combination platter of Catfish and Crab claws. OMG the Catfish was farm raised which I don't care and the Crab Claws were so HOT with Black Pepper I couldn't even eat them. They are also battered so HEAVILY WITH A CORNMEAL it's a shame. TERRIBLE, a $40 experience I will never forget."
The Seafood Bistro,4,"My husband and I had dinner here tonight and we thought it was all quite good. We had prompt and friendly service, and everything we ordered was tasty. We started with fried pickles, which were hot and the batter nice and crispy. Good seasoning. I ordered the fried oyster platter with coleslaw and hush puppies. The oysters were sweet and creamy. I could have done with a little bit less batter because the oysters themselves tasted fresh and didn't need covering up. My coleslaw and hush puppies were fine. I look forward to sampling some of the other sides. My husband ordered the gator po'boy with Cajun potatoes. He loved all of it. I sampled his gator and it had a nice, spicy seasoning. The beer selection could be better, but they make a michelada with Cajun seasoning, so I was happy. There are many options on the menu, so we'll be back to try some different items next time."
The Seafood Bistro,5,"Delicious spot! Born and raised Ragin Cajun from Lafayette, LA I know a good PoBoy when I have one. Seen a few reviews about the price, however at $12.99 for a piece for the size of these loaded PoBoys that come with a side too...really not that bad of a price. Music level was not that high as my wife and I could hold a conversation at a low level and still here each other. Manager was very friendly and courteous. Great lunch spot...see pictures!"
The Seafood Bistro,1,"This was the very worst food I have EVER had in my life. My great grandmother has been dying to try this spot and as a treat for her I had them delivered. $75 for calamari, shrimp and a few crab legs. She hated every bit of it. She was so disappointed, and it broke my heart as I rarely see her. She was disgusted."
The Seafood Bistro,1,I would give no stars if allowed. My hubby grabbed the crab claw meal and the shrimp dinner it cost us almost 37.00 and I feel robbed. I have never seen crab that was black on the inside. There was no flavor to it at all. I was scared to even finish eating it. We only ended up ordering from here online because we mixed it up with another restaurant. Save your money!!
The Seafood Bistro,4,"SPICY! Loved it! Garlic? I'm Louisiana raised. Crab legs were ON! Crawfish were flavored nice, hair pass prime. Hey, little salty on the calamari but I am a fan. thanks guys! Grub Hub thanks!"
K & J Rib Shack,5,"As soon as you step out of the car you smell the smoker...always a great sign for a BBQ place. Doesn't look like much on the outside, but the food is excellent. The gentleman working the counter was very kind. We ordered the pork ribs, pulled pork, collards, okra, Mac and cheese, red velvet cake, and sweet tea. Everything was very good. Will return is ever in Montgomery again."
K & J Rib Shack,4,"Friendly owners making solid authentic Dixie Q. We had the chicken, ribs, greens, black eyed peas, corn bread and some unsweetened tea.  Some downside.  Chicken has a serious smoke as noted by another reviewer.  Corn bread is pretty dry. Serve on trays for those eating in and save the styrofoam.  Too many disposables.  Really liked the ribs.  A little dried out in spots on the reheat. Good with or without the sauce. Loved the sides.  Will be back. You should check this place out."
K & J Rib Shack,3,"If you love your Q super heavy on smoke, this is your place.  The chicken was succulent and juicy, with a nicely balanced sauce.  It was a perfect condiment to the bird.  Partnered with the coleslaw and red beans and rice, it was a nice combination bite.  Alone, the smoke intense poultry was just too much for my tastebuds.  The much anticipated corn bread side was a complete disappointment.  It was deemed better suited to use in a stuffing drenched in stock.  The large pork ribs were untrimmed so you had to find the easy meat that can be released from the bone.  This was a toothsome endeavor, no fall off the bone meat here. Again, super smokey but at least the pork meat could stand up better flavor wise than the delicate chicken meat.  We sampled nothing that would draw us back here.  Satisfactory, but nothing special."
K & J Rib Shack,4,"This place is kind of the definition of a barbecue joint, with its smoker out front perfuming the air with the pungent aroma of smoked meats, and the humble interior belieing the quality of the food. In other words, the real Dixie. We stopped on our way through for lunch and were greeted by the friendly man at the counter. I opted for the smoked chicken leg quarter with collard greens and black eyed peas, and my partner had the half rack of ribs with the same two sides; both of us asked for sauce on the side. Each meal came with a cornbread muffin that was the kind I especially like; a bit crumbly and not too sweet. Of the two meats we picked, and I had some of both, the ribs were the winner~ a generous portion of nicely smoked and meaty ribs with the rib tip intact, still toothsome (if you've read any of my barbecue reviews, you know I detest overcooked meat). The chicken was a bit over smoked for my taste, but I admit that's a personal preference. They offer one sauce, a tangy and sweet tomato based sauce that was nice with the ribs. The sides were excellent. I teased the guy at the front because the covered pie plate on the counter was empty. Perhaps I'll get to try some pie on my next visit!"
K & J Rib Shack,5,"Took a bit to find this place, but once you get here, the BBQ smell was overwhelming. You know the BBQ will be excellent If the pit is in front of the restaurant. The owners welcomed us graciously and was very sincere. You know this place is run with heart and soul. The portions are HUGE, the taste was incredible and the service was genuine. They truly appreciate their customers. If you are looking for true BBQ tastes, come check out this place. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
K & J Rib Shack,5,BBQ at it finest .... Southern comfort as it best .... Old fashion good heart people ... you have to stop by and you will be back ... one of the best in the state of Alabama .... K&J has my vote ..... Mmmmmmmmmm Finger licking good
K & J Rib Shack,5,Stopped in due to reading other Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. The restaurant is very unassuming but don't let this fool you. The food is great and the prices reasonable for the large portions. It is a family business so there may be a short wait but it is definitely worth it.
K & J Rib Shack,5,"K & J have the best ribs in the Tri-County area... And cakes! And pies! Hidden jem.... Get the Kool-aid... Trust me, it's addictive."
K & J Rib Shack,5,"First time thru Alabama.  Looked on Yelp for local spot. Great reviews so we tried them. Wow!  Possibly the best ribs I've ever had.  A half a slab is plenty for 3 people. Authentic corn bread with collard greens, Mac n cheese, Lima beans and wedges.  Everything was good but the ribs are to die for. BBQ sauce is unassuming and delicious and doesn't take away from the smoky taste of the ribs. Staff is friendly and very social. We will come back again!!  There is seating inside ty I enjoy ty your food"
K & J Rib Shack,5,"The best ribs I've ever had in any style, anywhere. And the nicest people, too. I can't recommend this joint enough."
K & J Rib Shack,5,"From the moment we drive up, we knew this was a homey  family bbq joint. Luckily there were a few people in front of us but after we came in - a whole bunch walked in. The ow era were extremely friendly and oozing with love for people and their business! Sooooooo you can only imagine how good the ribs, chicken, collard greens, black eyed peas and yams were. And we topped it off with amazing pound cake! I wish we lived here, but sadly home calls. If we are ever back- we will visit you. Thank you for the amazing food, great conversation and decadent dessert. Just like my grandma used to make! We wish you years of success!!!"
K & J Rib Shack,2,"On a drive to the coast, three of us stopped in based on the Yelp reviews. I have no problem with dives, but many will be revolted by this place. My group of three covered most of the menu with half-rack, pork dinner, and brisket dinner. I've spent decades eating BBQ frequently, 98% in west TN and eastern Arkansas. K & J is easily a bottom-three BBQ experience of my lifetime. Mediocre at best (ribs), downright bad (pork saturated in sweet syrupy sauce) at worst. A cautionary lesson in the limitations of Yelp."
K & J Rib Shack,5,"Easily the best BBQ I've ever had. We evacuated from Florida to Alabama to get away from Hurricane Irma and I had a craving for some good southern soul food. This place had good reviews for the most part so, we decided to check it out. Oh man, we are so glad we did! We pull up and see the huge smoker out front. As soon as we got out of the car, we were welcomed by that delicious smoky BBQ smell. Once we entered, we placed our order with the super friendly lady at the counter. I ordered the pulled pork dinner with collards and mac n' cheese. This place is a tiny shack but, don't let the appearance fool you, the food served here is truly special. My pulled pork was juicy, tender, and super flavorful. The pork had that perfect smoky coating while easily pulling apart with a fork. The collards were delicious and well-cooked with a great flavor. The mac n' cheese was baked nice and cheesy. Everything was absolutely delicious. The BBQ places back home don't even compare. I'm not sure when or if I'll be back in Montgomery but, if I find myself in the area - I will make it a point to stop here as the food was that good."
K & J Rib Shack,1,"I don't understand how this place is the #1 BBQ place in Montgomery. My buddy was in from Utah and wanted BBQ, so we got on Yelp to find the best place. According to other people, K&J is fantastic, which is the exact opposite of what we experienced last night. First off, I am not hard to please. My only expectation is that when I pay you for a meal I want it to taste better than if I prepared it myself. If it's not even as good as I can make for 1/5th of the cost, then I don't want it. From the time we walked in to the time we got our food was 55 minutes. Yes. Seriously. 55 minutes. It really wasn't that busy and it isn't that big of a place. I figured the food must be really good because it took so long to prepare. It took so long, in fact, that they gave people their food one at a time. There were two other tables while we were there and people would be finished eating before everyone at their table even got their food. Now. The food itself. I got a pulled pork sandwich and mac'n'cheese. My buddy got ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, okra, and mac'n'cheese. Friends, I'm not exaggerating when I tell you it was straight up one of the worst BBQ meals I've ever had. The pork was incredibly tough and the mac'n'cheese tasted as if it had been sitting out for a while. And by ""a while"" I mean three days. It was stale and bland. My buddy gave me a rib and it was tough and flavorless. He agreed with my assessment of the pork and mac'n'cheese. He said the only part of his meal that was decent was the okra. The only thing I invested at K&J that's was worth anything was their sauce. These folks at least make a good BBQ sauce. To put it in perspective, I've been in the Army for fifteen years. I've eaten some really terrible food in some really terrible places. With that said, given the choice between K&J and an MRE, I'd take an MRE. Think about that for a moment. That's how terrible K&J was last night. It's possible they were having an off night, though I'll never know because I won't be going back."
K & J Rib Shack,3,Local favor and good value.  Simple homestyle building with handwritten menu.  A bit dated within but the food flavor good and inexpensive.
K & J Rib Shack,5,"Please for the love of all that is good, stop here for a meal if you're headed south on I65...well worth the few minutes off the freeway to get some great BBQ.We had the pulled pork and pulled chicken....both were on point.Sides, fried corn, Black eyed peas, Lima beans, baked beans were all amazing."
K & J Rib Shack,1,"Beef ribs tough & over cooked, no love for this spot & never again!!! Pit master should make pizzas only."
K & J Rib Shack,4,"Don't let the simple interior or unassuming exterior deter you from a great BBQ restaurant. This is not a franchise, but a friendly, hole-in-the-wall, family owned restaurant. The menu is on chalk board behind the counter and fairly self-explanatory, but if you take your time to read it or decide, no one taking the order will get mad or rush you. This is a choice place for smokey, tender ribs. The half rack order (seven ribs) was huge! The fries were fresh, thin cut (shoestring), and made to order, but were bit soggy. Not a deal breaker. If you put K&J's sauce on an old tin can, I'd probably eat it. -half rack of ribs-fries"
K & J Rib Shack,5,"Best BBQ in Montgomery. Smoker Parked out front. Wonderfully nice people, amazing flavor, great service, special place, can't believe we found it on the way to the airport one day, will end a regular stop now. Had the ribs, Lima beans and greens. All fantastic. Want to eat every side!"

Martha’s Place,5,"I came here with a group of around 12 people and they were able to accommodate us pretty quickly without calling ahead. The buffet included many different southern style foods, including fried chicken, yams, sweet potatoes, liver, meatloaf, collard greens, mashed potatoes. The food was pretty well stocked while we were there and the fresh fried chicken kept on coming out. As we were finishing up eating, someone came up to our table and it was Martha herself. It's nice to see the owner of the restaurant come and greet their guests and make sure that we had a great experience and enjoyed her food. P.S. They also offer a military discount"
Martha’s Place,5,"This place needs a solid 5 star!! If you want real homey soul food, this is the place to be. It opens at 11am on weekdays but there is always a few people waiting 15 minutes before it opens. It is very popular amongst the locals. Since we got there right when it opened, we did not have to wait for a table. The ambiance is very nice, open, clean and lots of space/tables. Everything on the menu was just delicious, be the the juicy fried chicken or the salads or the meats or the banana pudding. With so many options, anyone who eats here is bound to find dishes they like. They even serve complimentary iced tea and lemonade with unlimited refills. The service is excellent as well. When the server saw how much we loved the lemonade, she even gave us a complimentary cup of lemonade to go. Amazing experience and I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. Do not miss if you are in the area!!"
Martha’s Place,5,"this was a good spot to eat too. Another soul food buffet!! it is very inexpensive and had very good food! before going home we were told to try this restaurant out. $11 buffet and it was worth every penny!! The service was kind of slow when it came getting are sits organized, but that didn't take away from the good experience!! I went with family and they had not one complaint either!! I would highly recommend if you are looking a restaurant that is cost friendly and with good food!"
Martha’s Place,5,"First trip to Alabama and found ourselves here for lunch one day with a group of 6. I can't believe the amazing meal we got for $9 a person. The restaurant is so well cared for and way more beautiful than any buffet i've ever seen. In fact, i'm usually not a buffet person at all but you can tell how much Martha and her staff care about this place, its patrons and the food they are putting out. Loved being able to try all of my usual comfort food favorites along with trying some new ones. That fried chicken was amazing but the baked chicken was the surprise winner (for me) for the day. Delicious all around and probably the best meal our group had during our time in Montgomery. Worth a detour for sure."
Martha’s Place,5,"If you have never experienced the beauty, the love, and the pure delight that is deep down Southern cooking, Martha's Place is the go to spot! From crispy and delicious Southern fried chicken, melt in your mouth pot roast, flavored and seasoned collard greens, the cheesiest mac n cheese you could ever dream of, and...the true star of the show...the DRESSING. I know some people call it stuffing but this is DRESSING! It dresses up any meal, it dresses up your life! I want a bathtub full of Martha's place dressing in my house at all times, that's how good it is. I've tried to get my cornbread dressing to come out like Martha's and I can't figure out the secret! It's glorious, I heard angels sing when I first tasted that dressing, I felt love pour all over me. There's also desserts and various salads, but trust me, go for the dressing and feel the South embrace you with Martha's love."
Martha’s Place,5,This place was a hidden gem! We tried it last night and were very impressed. For $11 you can have an amazing spread of southern food! I will be back!
Martha’s Place,5,I went there for the first time about a couple of weeks ago and the food and service was amazing. Loved the atmosphere as well. Great price! Good down home cooking!
Martha’s Place,5,"I was in Montgomery for a military training trip and I ran across this restaurant. Boy this is a hidden gem. The ambience was very nice the customer service was very pleasing and the food was tasty. I had the fried chicken and I have to say that this was some of the best fried chicken I've had in a while. The owner, Ms Martha took the time to visit each table to a sure that everyone had a pleasant experience. We were able to sit down and talk to her and learn more about her story. We were so inspired that we bought her book that talked about her life. If you are looking for a tasty clean and upscale soulful buffet this is a choice that I would highly recommend."
Martha’s Place,1,"Here visiting Alabama state university from northern Virginia... searched for black owned restaurants. This was our first choice.  I brought my daughter, close friend and her daughter along with me.  We were excited after reading the reviews until we sat at our table.  We noticed others eating with no drinks but shortly the waitress brought out their drinks.  She looked over and said she would return with our drinks.  She came back out and walked up to our table and said, ""what y'all drinking""... so my friend said ""hello, how are you"", the waitress responded, ""I'm good what are yall drinking""... so my friend said nicely, ""that's good, we're all well"", the waitress was super annoyed and responded, ""nice"" sarcastically.... she took our drink order but I was really disgusted with her attitude.  So I walked up to ask for a refund, the hostess said she was going to get the manager, the manager never came out but I was refunded.  We left and decided to try Pierce's Country Cooking... so glad we did.  Another black owned restaurant with AWESOME SERVICE!  We were greeted nicely... the food tasted and looked amazing!  I will forever be a fan!  We really enjoyed the ribs, baked chicken, collards, Mac n cheese, sweet potatoe pie but most of all the hospitality!  The staff was amazing!"
Martha’s Place,5,My very first time eating here since she moved from her last location food is excellent Dressing and turkey superb so I say Martha's has still got it
Martha’s Place,5,Awesome soul food. The price is unbelievable for this all you can eat southern comfort food restaurant. I will definitely visit again. Wish I'd discovered it sooner. The food choices include multiple vegetables and meat choices. The meats change according to the day of the week. Multiple desserts are also included in the price.You must give it a try!
Martha’s Place,1,"Please avoid! ~~...  County health dept. just gave it an 87 rating for cornbread batter being left out at an improper temperature, and for ROACHES being in the kitchen.  WFSA news reported this on 12/12/19."
Martha’s Place,5,"Just traveling through Montgomery and found out my old ""go to"" place for Southern food had closed. Saw this on Yelp, and glad I did!  Very reasonably priced, delicious Southern cuisine, fantastic fried green tomatoes, and unbelievable banana pudding. Will definitely be back next time I am through Montgomery."
Martha’s Place,5,"Great, fresh food.  The owner is super sweet.  Restaurant is clean- bathrooms are clean.  We will visit every time we travel to Montgomery."
Martha’s Place,4,"The food is pretty good, but it's incredibly hot inside this restaurant. I usually get to-go orders because the heat is unbearable. I've been eating at this restaurant since it was at the old location. It's a good place to go and get a full soul food meal."
Martha’s Place,4,Food was absolutely amazing. I truly enjoyed myself. And meat was seasoned well. I definitely will recommend to others and return again when I'm in town.
Martha’s Place,5,"Very good soul food from fried chicken to hot wings, catfish and the lemon chicken wings are zesty and delicious along with the scallop potatoes, squash, & Lima beans. This is our second trip from Florida"
Martha’s Place,5,The best soul food buffet!! Everything was amazing and they are always accommodating to large groups!
Martha’s Place,4,"I was in Montgomery, AL the last week of June 2018 and found this place doing an internet search and my taste buds thanked me so much that I think I ate everything before I got back to the house!  I had rice, baked turkey & dressing, potato salad, pasta salad, and greens.  I was glad we got there before what must have been the lunch crowd.  I would stay and dine in if I ever get back to Montgomery, because it's decorated very nicely.My four star rating is because there was no blackberry cobbler available when I called on the day it was supposed to be there.  Maybe, Martha's can have all desserts on all the days it's open!"
Martha’s Place,4,The waitress was awesome. The chicken and fish was seasoned well and the cheese potatoes was really good. My only complaint was for a buffet i expecting it to have more variety of food.  I was really hoping they were going to have macaroni and cheese
City Grill,5,"My husband and I decided to try City Grill on New Year's Eve! What a perfect meal and night it was! We split a bottle of wine, shared the fried eggplant for an appetizer, my Fried Goat Cheese Salad And Duck were to die for and that apple dessert...  I highly recommend this restaurant! We will most definitely be coming back!"
City Grill,4,"City Grill is hidden inside of a shopping center off of Taylor Rd.  My husband and I dined here for our anniversary.  Our server made our experience very enjoyable and memorable.  The salmon was delicious!  My husband's steak was cooked right the first time.  They have a nice atmosphere, nothing bad to say about this place."
City Grill,4,"We dined here on a Saturday with a reservation for two. We started with the crab cakes. So delicious! Excellent flavor! I had the spinach salad. The lettuce was crisp and the dressing was just right. For our main course, I had the grilled snapper with the Mediterranean toppings. My husband had the lamb shank with gnocchi. We both loved our food, and each others. We ended with dessert, a flourless chocolate cake with homemade whipped cream. It was light and delicious. Our server was excellent. We would return for another excellent meal."
City Grill,5,One of the best restaurants in Montgomery! I've never had a bad meal and the atmosphere is first class!
City Grill,4,"My last night in Montgomery was spent having dinner here and the service we had made our experience as well.  We called 20 minutes prior to arriving and put our name on the list for a table.  Everyone was kind and our waitress was great. We started out with their Tuna Napoleon appetizer. I really liked it. It was light and just the right size to share. For dinner we had their scallops with pasta special and snapper with a lump of crab meat on top. I will say I loved the scallops better than the snapper meal. The snapper and crab was a little bland and the scallops had so much flavor! If I could have exchanged my meal for the scallops, that's what I would have done. The absolute BEST part of my meal was naturally, dessert!! If you plan on having dessert, you need to try their salted caramel cheesecake. I would go back there just to eat cheesecake! We paired it with one of their coffees that had mixed liquor and it was perfect. After that we had some sips of Sambuca. It was my first time trying it and boy does it sting the moment you take a sip! It has a black licorish taste. Overall it was a great place to try and I'm glad I made it here before I left."
City Grill,5,"I arranged a girls golf trip to Prattville, AL for 12 ladies who are ""foodies"" as well as golfers so our expectations are very high.  This was the best dining experience I've had in a long time.  We were put into a private room with a waitress who is probably the best in her profession.  She was friendly, professional and provided recommendations when asked.  The food was perfect!  Not one complaint about any item and we ordered quite a variety of appetizers, salads, entrees and desserts.  Everything was great.  I would have heard the complaints if there had been any because I was responsible for choosing everything about the trip including choosing this restaurant!  I'd like to drive the 3 1/2 hours back to eat there again."
City Grill,3,"An okay place to grab a decent meal, just hit-or-miss with the quality.I've eaten here several times. Service is great. The food...well, sometimes its five star and sometimes two. I've had great steaks here, but I've had terribly overcooked fish and duck as well.Their beer selection is almost non-existent. One of the waiters even suggested I go next door to the Tipping Point if I wanted a delicious brew (to be fair to him, he did not say this in a negative or condescending fashion). I seriously considered just walking out and getting my meal there instead. Alas, my wife vetoed that idea.I would suggest a steak here, as that seems to have the most consistent quality."
City Grill,3,"Atmosphere: sophisticated and formalStaff: friendlyHowever, the price was not worth the food that     we ate. I got the ribeye with fries. The waitress overhyped the fries and when received, the fries were soggy and limp. Less than satisfactory to say the least. Steak was good, but not to the amount they were priced for. Though the size of the steak was big, it had a lot of fat on it and not as much meat. Good for a one time experience, but not a place for ongoing future meals."
City Grill,5,"We had the snapper and New York strip specials. The Snapper was delicious! The steak was good too but lacked a little something. Loved the Parmesan fries too! We had the baked feta appetizer, which was also delicious. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend this place, even though it's a little pricey."
City Grill,5,The Eggplant lump crab appetizer with the pear arugala  salad was lovely & decadent at same time.  Did not need entre. Sorry!  Perfect for waistline.  Love the bar ambiance.  Right combination of class & casual.  So there.
City Grill,5,"Excellent food and service in a wonderful community. Stop by for a drink, dinner, dessert, or all of the above... you won't be disappointed. If the weather is nice, grab a seat on the patio and relax while the great team helps ensure you have a wonderful visit."
City Grill,5,"The best restaurant in Montgomery and a match for the better restaurants in Atlanta in Montgomery.  Having eaten here numerous times I can highly recommend the daily fish with beurre blanc sauce, the lamb, or any steak.  Service is always excellent and the dishes are consistent and outstanding.  Don't miss the chocolate molten cake!!!!  The hometown feel makes this place all the better."
City Grill,5,"Very nice experience at City Grill last evening. The snapper specials were wonderfully prepared offering both traditional and Mediterranean flavor depending upon your taste. The other entree, the surf and turf was delicious. All in all, a delightful dining experience and one that we hope to repeat often!"
City Grill,5,"The atmosphere is comfortable, but not fancy.  Avoid the booths.  They are more private, but are also quite uncomfortable.  The food here is very good.  Service is excellent, top notch.  Servers are friendly, informed and attentive without being intrusive.  You can have a very good dinner here.  Yes, you'll pay $$$, but City Grill is worth it.  City Grill is not frou-frou fancy, but it's comfortable.   Some folks come in a bit more dressed up, others are pretty casual.  We've had two great meals here.  From appetizers to mains to desserts, everything here is very good!  This is my number once choice in Montgomery (above True & Central).  Other restaurants in Montgomery should take a note from the chef & staff at City Grill.  Food:              5/5Service:          5/5Value for $$:  5/5Will I return:  Yes!Would I recommend City Grill:  Yes"
City Grill,5,Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Have no complaints. My husband and I split the calamari appetizer and one of the salads. Then we each had our own steak. And finished with the lava chocolate cake topped with peanut butter ice cream. Everything was flavorful and delicious with great service. Will definitely return.
City Grill,5,"CONSISTENT! This is one of the most reliably excellent places in town. Outstanding wine list, always fresh and perfectly prepared gulf seafood, attentive servers who know the menu extremely well. Elegant, quiet atmosphere."
City Grill,5,What a charming place! We just stopped by for drinks and apps and really enjoyed it. Lovely atmosphere and great service.
City Grill,5,"Next time you are at City Grille, try the halloumi cheese salad.  It is amazing.  Great house wine selection."
City Grill,4,"The Hampstead still has a lot of work to do, but it's good to see places like City Grill having already taken up root. My experiences with fine dining in this city have been pretty touch and go, but it usually comes down to a matter of value. If I'm going to spend twenties of dollars for an entree, I want to know there's some technical skill going into it. A chicken might not seem like the most elegant protein for a meal, but there is quite a bit of technical finesse in cooking an entire bird, and the half poussin I ordered - partly because it's fun to say ""poussin"" - was a fairly well-done balance of the white and dark meat along with the crispiness of the skin. It was also a pretty freaking large portion for one person - I was served half of a four pound bird, leaving me to figure out how to best attack the thing with my knife and fork. After half an hour, I just went to town using my hands. The passage of time has me forgetting everything about that meal other than the bird itself, which is probably a testament to City Grill and a reason why it's worth making the trip - it's a Montgomery restaurant that not only understands what goes into fine dining, but gives you ample portions for the money."
City Grill,5,"Visiting from Virginia. The meal my husband and I ate at this restaurant has become the one to beat when dining out. We had the halloumi cheese salad-amazing!! Salmon with Brussel sprouts and potatoes-amazing!! And the Lava cake with peanut butter ice cream for dessert-so amazing!! We split everything so we weren't stuffed and feeling disgusting after our meal. It was perfect. I would visit this place again and again if we ever find ourselves back in Montgomery.*I will add that I wish they used fresh caught salmon vs farmed, especially for the prices they charge!"
Vintage Year,5,I really like this place! Service is excellent and the food creative and locally sourced. Good wines available and very fair prices.
Vintage Year,4,"Their service during covid was on-par, their burgers on Tuesday were amazing. Highly recommended"
Vintage Year,5,I went to Vintage Year for the first time for a birthday dinner with a friend. We opted to sit outside since it was a nice evening. My friend made reservations so we were promptly seated. Our waitress was very pleasant. She patiently went over menu items and made recommendations when asked. We had the creamy seafood dip for our appetizer. I had the snapper and my friend had the lamb. It was all delicious. This is a hidden gem in Montgomery. Give it a try.
Vintage Year,4,"The decor and ambiance is excellent, the food options are limited because they have seasonal options.  Started with crab cakes and it was tasty with the aioli.  I had the snapper with the curry sauce and it was tasty, large portion.  My friend had the lamb and it was a small portion especially for the price. The lamb were 2 small pieces of lamb with bone in."
Vintage Year,5,"The food was absolutely amazing, the service was even better. It says causal dining but we were a lil uncomfortable in our everyday outfits, a little bit more classy. Our waitress definitely made our visits as well as the atmosphere :) it was fantastic. I would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area. But I highly recommend this place."
Vintage Year,5,Visited Montgomery for the CLAS Conference. This place was recommended and it didn't disappoint. It was Burger Tuesday so I got the Philly burger which was excellent. It was a nice evening so we sat outside. The waiter was awesome. I plan to visit each time I come to Montgomery. Everyone else at the table was also pleased with their entrees.
Vintage Year,4,Fantastic service and foodFor smokers a no goYou must walk to the cornerFresh ingredients and I highly recommend the cheese board
Vintage Year,5,"This is the BEST restaurant in Montgomery, hands down! It's a pretty space, romantic, on the quieter side. The staff is excellent and accommodating​. I have many foods I​ can't eat, gluten for one, and they went out of their way to substitute and accommodate me.The filet was cooked to perfection! The mac and cheese the best in Montgomery, the Yellowfin over coconut broth with lemongrass delicious!! Great place for date night."
Vintage Year,5,"One of the best dining experiences ever!! Where do I start? Ahh, yes, at the beginning. Let's just say the food, the service, the company, and the fellowship were outstanding.My wife and I are in town for the Family Life Weekend to Remember marriage retreat and tonight was our ""date night."" After initially trying to go to Central restaurant--we didn't have a reservation and they didn't take walk-ins--we decided to try Vintage Year. What a blessing. Without a doubt, God set that up. He closed the door at Central and opened the one at Vintage. Service:Our server Jennifer was the bomb! Fast as lightning, very attentive, very accommodating, very personable, knew the menu in and out, attended to our every need, described the dishes so descriptively, and even gave us some history about the restaurant. She's a great marketer. But what she was selling, the chefs and the kitchen staff backed it up. I should also give a shoutout to the team who was supporting her, because she didn't do it alone. I think there were 4 other people who bought items to the table whether it was bread, an appetizer or entree. Everyone, including the host, were very personable, professional, attentive and accommodating.Food:Everything, and I mean everything, was sumptuous. The seafood gratin with shrimp, crab, scallops and crawfish was good, but could have benefited from a little more salt. It came with toasted baguettes that were a little too toasted for my taste. Almost like cajun style. The filet with roasted sweet potatoes and crispy, fried onion strings were so tasty. The short ribs with scalloped potatoes and red cabbage--oh my goodness--was mmm, mmm, mmm. The short ribs were so tender and well-seasoned. They would've been falling off the bone had there been one. The potatoes were creamy and seasoned. And the purple cabbage was a complete surprise. They were tender with a nice bite and a tasty sauce. We also got a side of Brussel sprouts and they were deelish. Packed with bacon fat and salt, they were crispy and tender and so, so good. For dessert we had the chocolate moon pie, which reminded me of a glorified s'more. With chocolate cake and graham cracker on top and bottom with a thick homemade marshmallow in the center, and covered in chocolate ganache. We were so full by then, we could only take a couple bites, but it was good too. Company:Lastly, the company was a true blessing. Seated next to us were Pat McGregor and her granddaughter, Mary Grace. They were so beautiful to talk to. I see great things in Mary Grace's future. She was very poised, a lady, outgoing, respectful, hospitable, true to her faith, and just loving on her grandmother, who recently lost her husband. Just an all around sweet person. It was an absolute pleasure talking to both of them. They offered us a taste of their desserts and let us listen to her recording artist sister Elizabeth Ann Matthews. So go check out her new single."
Vintage Year,5,"My fiancée and I went to Vintage Year for the first time on 12/10/19 to celebrate our engagement and couldn't have had a better time. Our server, Jennifer, was so wonderful and down to earth and gave great suggestions. The food and cocktails were unreal and we were just amazed overall. It was a wonderful experience and we will highly recommend it to everyone we know!"
Vintage Year,5,We  were visiting Madison and our guide and a few locals recommended this restaurant  Lucky for us they had a cancellation on Tuesday night which is burger night the burger  where very good I had a falafel burger excellent came with fries Cesar salad with kale  was excellent pricing was very fair and if you don't want burger they a regular menu you can order from   the waitress was very nice knowledgeable and efficient it was  husband and my anniversary she gave us a complimentary cheesecake excellent That always  make you know they are  Customer friendlyThe restaurant had a charming decor Wish we could go again so if we are ever in town again we will make. Reservations So if you are in Montgomery Alabama make you reservations soon then later.
Vintage Year,5,We wandered in by accident when we found our first choice was closed on Sunday.  VY is open for Sunday brunch and had a greatly varied array of offerings. I had the salad with a poached egg and my friend had the crab cakes with poached eggs and hollandaise--both were excellent. Interesting cocktails including local specials. Lots of coffee and biscuits and we were able to sit and chat without being rushed out.  Our waiter was solicitous without hovering and helped us with local info--we are tourists. A great spot and I only wish we could go back for dinner!
Vintage Year,5,"26 January 2019 I wife and I and two of our friends were in the area and decided to give this place a try we were not disappointed. We had an early reservation. Who agreed upon entry and quickly showed our table our server was very knowledgeable about the menu. The wait staff was also very prompt.We started with the cheeseboard to share. For the second course each person had a salad. The salads were fresh and served on a chilled plate, for the entrées two people order the fillet which they said was cooked to perfection medium rare, I ordered the scallops they were very good served over a bed of black risotto, and the last entrée was a whole head on Mediterranean sea bass which I was told was excellent! We finished all of our meals with shared desserts which were very good as well. the location might make you think something else about this establishment but don't let the exterior fool you. Next time we are in the Montgomery area we are definitely going back."
Vintage Year,4,"I had a nice dinner here. The menu is not too complicated or fussy, and the service is attentive.I enjoyed scotch eggs, a burger, and a massive salad.The only reason I hesitate to say ""five stars"" is that prices are higher, and everything I had (while delicious) was pretty straightforward. Nothing surprised me.If you want a very good meal, with good service in a nice (yet not quite formal) setting, Vintage Year is an excellent choice.  I would say it is even better for larger parties where everyone will find something they love."
Vintage Year,5,This is the best restaurant! Started off with crab cakes as our appetizer. Then- I had Yellowfin Tuna. My hubby had Lamb Chops. So fresh and so good. Cocktails and dessert/coffee equally as delicious. The staff was very attentive and informative. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend!!
Vintage Year,5,"Some of the best food I've had in Montgomery, period. While their dinners ante amazing (and the ambiance delightful), I find their weekend brunches to be the best meals. The VY burger is phenomenal, and the fries could carry an entire meal by themselves. The brunch menu has some of the most...luscious? Luscious is how to describe was I saw and tasted."
Vintage Year,5,Probably my favorite spot. Brunch is great on Sunday but you will need to reserve. They book up fast. Customer service is outstanding every time I go. I love the avocado devil eggs.
Vintage Year,5,"During a short trip to Montgomery, had the pleasure of eating at this gem of a restaurant.  The crab cake appetizer, gulf snapper, and venison steak were all excellent.  The chef really nails it with all of these dishes."
Vintage Year,1,The condescending attitude of the hostess when we walked in was enough for us to not bother to wait for a table.
Vintage Year,5,We just had dinner at Vintage Year. Sat in the bar and Michelle was amazing. Friendly and helpful. Food was amazing. Will definitely go back when in Montgomery!
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,5,Five out of five for your great curbside pickup we had last Saturday night.  We picked up the family pack of hour fried chicken.  It was delicious and hot and abundant!  Thank you so much for feeding us at home.
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,5,"I am in love with this restaurant, the prices are a little high but the quality is well worth it. I have been here almost every Friday for Happy Hour, the manager walks around to see his regulars and also make new ones. This is one of the best restaurants in town and my go-to for mexican food. Just delicious and did I mention how wonderful the staff is."
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,1,"I know most people absolutely love Little Donkey, but we've been several times and have never had a good experience. The biggest problem is that this place is ridiculously expensive for a lot of mediocre food. The queso was $6.50, but was the equivalent of just melted cheese. If we're paying nearly $7 for queso, we expect it to have some sort of meat and not taste like a melted block of velveeta cheese. The chips that came with our queso were overcooked. Taco combos are nearly $12, and come with rice that tastes like Zataran's minute microwave white rice. I liked the beans, but they were pinto beans that did not go well with the meal. The tacos were good, but just too expensive. Enchiladas are $15, which is just crazy. Our service has always been lackluster as well. This place is cool and hipster, but every time we've gone we have gotten not great food and paid an arm and a leg for it. I know Montgomery struggles with having decent Mexican food, but Sol and Taco Shop beat this place by a mile and are actually reasonably priced. Don't be tricked by the hip and cool vibe from this place into wasting your time or money. It won't be worth it."
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,3,"Let me start with the overall atmosphere.... It was very lackluster. It was in no way reminiscent of a Mexican restaurant. More of just a casual dining restaurant that could serve any type of food.The food...The Top Shelf Margarita with a strawberry swirl was delicious! It was the best part of the meal! The food was okay at best, however, I've had way better come from my own kitchen. The food was just not seasoned. I had the grilled fish tacos with pinto beans and rice. The fish tasted like it was just thrown on a grill minus salt and pepper. Some Old Bay seasoning would have gone a long way! The rice just tasted funny. Like nothing, I've ever eaten before. It just tasted kind of weird. I can't really describe it. My friend had the fried chicken and ""smashed potatoes."" She was underwhelmed as well! She said the potatoes were really hard. I tasted her chicken skin and while it was very crispy, it tasted like it was fried in old or burnt grease. The employees...Rod was a killjoy!!!  He ""greeted"" and sat us. It seemed like he was tired... It was 8 pm... We tried to joke with him by asking him to smile but it just seemed like he wasn't in the mood to smile. Now KP, our server, was WONDERFUL!!! She had a great personality. She was friendly and professional. She made an otherwise okay experience pretty decent. All in all, it is an okay restaurant with average tasting food. It was definitely not worth the $53 + $10 tip, I spent."
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,1,Honestly one of the worst mexican restaurants i've ever been to. I had the burrito bowl and the chicken wasn't seasoned at all and the guac had way to much lime juice not to mention the over buttered corn that came with it. Not to mention we weren't given silverware so we had to wait a few mins after our food arrived to eat.
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,5,Great find in Montgomery! Great happy hour specials and daily specials. Tortillas hand made just behind bar- corn ground fresh here! Paloma margarita was a personal fav! Told to come back and try the fried chicken. Fried chicken taco is worth coming back for!
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,4,Great tacos and one of my favorite queso dips!I would recommend y'all to adding some grilled onions to your tacos next time around here !
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,4,It is nice and tasty Mexican restaurant at eastchase Not that priceyNice bar and plenty of kinds of beverages
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,3,"UPDATE: I still like the food but feel like cheated today. Look at the picture... they charged a little extra for everything. Enchilada : menu price $14 but charged $15, 2 carnitas and 2 adobadas should be 7.50 not 7.90,  3 briskets should be $12.75 not $13.50. If menu has changed they should let people know before ordering. This is bad practice."
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,4,"This is a great little restaurant. The decor and ambiance is modern mexican and vibrant, so much better than a lot of the dark restaurant ambiance vibes you normally get dining out. Their fried chicken came recommended and it was very tasty. A nice crunch on the outside and lots of juicy flavor on the inside. The sides were also tasty, the corn was delicious. Our meal came with complimentary chips and salsa which were ok but not amazing! The service was a little slow considering they were busy and our server seemed extremely unhappy that she got sat yet another table however, I empathize given it was mother's day and she was probably tired from having such a busy shift. Overall, a nice restaurant, recommended for sure!"
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,5,"This is NOT a Mexican Restaurant. It's a restaurant with in-house ingredients like guac, cilantro and salsas on amazing bases of grilled breads and tortillas. You'll find proteins like smothered fried or smoked chicken and more. In other words- it's far better than a Mexican restaurant. BTW- The chicken is fantastic. They must be frying that bird in manna oil (or opiates)- something makes it ridiculously tender. There is a little side patio under twinkle lights. Nice touch. Chips and salsa- chips good but very salty. Salsa not my favorite- pretty liquified and in too small of a bowl to effectively swoop into with a chip. I usually eat my weight in chips and salsa while waiting for a refried bean laden tortilla to get plopped down in front of me. And I love it. This is better. So despite the small salsa serving, I was gratefulto have plenty of room for the main event. Delicious, nice portion size, tastes seriously fresh and is a nice combination of flavors on the main course. Our server was polite and attentive. We stayed long after our meal, chatting on the patio as the table wasn't in demand that late. We had a great time and will definitely be back."
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,5,"What a gem. We were blown away by the hospitality and the delicious cutters. We both had the fajitas (chicken and beef brisket) and cleaned our plates. The brisket was perfectly seasoned and literally melted away each bite.The beer selection is outstanding and the manager went out of his way to talk to us about the many options and his recommendations.This place is gold dust, all the stars."
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,5,"Over the years we have settled in on our favorite restaurants in Montgomery and the greater Montgomery Metroplex.  This Saturday was our first opportunity to return to Little Donkey in EastChase for some great Mexican food.  We've been eating at Little Donkeys before the Montgomery location opened two years ago having lunched at their locations in Homewood and on I-280 in Inverness.  Mrs. Bunny and I have been on the road for the past few weekends so today featured our first lunch date at our home Donkey this month.At 1pm on the first college football weekend of the season there were still available tables so we were able to grab our personal two-topper and placed our orders with server Mason.  We passed on ""the first one is free"" Chips and Salsa as we didn't care to fill up before the main event.  Sweet Tea for me, Coke for Mrs. Bunny (not her usual water).  She ordered a Chicken Burrito with Guacamole while I got Brisket Tamales with Black Beans and Rice.  Food came out hot and fast just as Manager Davis stopped by to greet us.  He gave us an update on former Manager Sam who is now a Manager at Rodney Scott's BBQ in Charleston, SC. Rodney Scott's is part of a larger consortium of restaurants which includes Little Donkey, Jim 'n Nick's and Big Bad Breakfast.  Manager Sam may eventually move over to the new location of Charleston's Big Bad Breakfast when all plans are finalized and the location built out.  Sam and his staff made the Montgomery Little Donkey a success and I trust he will do well in Charleston.Mrs. Bunny said that the Chicken in her Burrito was some of the best she's had.  She also stated that it's a shame that we can't find much other food in the area as good as what we get at Little Donkey.  My Brisket Tamales were excellent, just like the first ones I had a month ago. Everything is fresh and crafted with care.  Server Mason made sure our drinks did not run dry.Great food and excellent service is what you'll find at Little Donkey in EastChase in Montgomery.  Stop by today and try some of their Mexican dishes.  They are also known for their Fried Chicken."
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,5,BEST. FRIED. CHICKEN. Oh my goooosh. Decent selection of drinks too! The atmosphere is relaxing and the food is always so TASTY!
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,5,"Wow! If you enjoy variety and Southwest Tex-mex, then this establishment is a must visit. This was a place a looked up and found on Yelp and was a wonderful find during my visit to the Capital City. You have a choice of salsa and I went with the verde. The flavor was wonderful and I enjoyed the fresh chips. I went with the grilled fish tacos. They come with your choice of two sides and flour or corn soft shells. You must try the corn and I enjoyed the fresh salad greens. A great ""local"" eatery. They do have a location in Birmingham."
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,2,"This place is simply overpriced for both the quality and quantity of the food that you receive. $15 for enchiladas, rice, and beans?? Approximately $12 for 2 tacos, rice, and beans?? However, you may be thinking that because you are paying a slightly higher price for your food that the quality will be better than your average Mexican restaurant, but you will be sorely disappointed. The food is no different than any other Mexican restaurant's food so save yourself $10 and eat at Sol or The Taco Shop."
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,5,"I live in the Birmingham area and I've visited the Homewood location (which was great!).  The Montgomery location was an equally awesome experience. My husband had the shrimp and grits. It's not traditional, however, their Spanish flare on this dish hits all the flavor pockets just right! I had the chicken taco on a corn tortilla which was simple and perfectly executed. We'd read on Yelp that the fried chicken is amazing. So.. we added 1 pc. to split before we left. (The fried chicken is traditional) Y'all!!! This was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had... Ever! I'll definitely order that next time.Our server at this location was Shai. She was so kind, helpful and a true example of great customer service!"
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,5,Really enjoyed the tacos here I had to pay extra $4 because I wanted shrimp tacos but the shrimp are so large totally worth it . Sides were ok pintos could've been cooked a little longer. Restaurant was nice and clean went in around 3pm on a Monday no lines with about two people still in the restaurant after the lunch hour rush. Mason was my server very nice and gave a memorable experience. Food was hot and fresh and when I say fresh I mean fresh I know they are home growing all of there ingredients in the back lol! Will be back
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,3,"Poor service really drove down our visit.  Couldn't understand why our server kept focusing on other tables...even walking past our table without even acknowledging a drink glass was empty!?!  Otherwise the food was very good.My wife ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich.  A great bet even at a ""Mexican"" restaurant.  I had two pork tacos, Adobado and Carnitas.  Found both to be very flavorful and enjoyable.  For sides we shared smashed potatoes and street style corn.  The smashed potatoes are not traditional mashed potatoes.  They are essentially baked potatoes cut in to chunks and fried.  Super good.  The street style corn typically comes on the cob but we asked for it to be cut off the cob.  The cheese and seasoning on top really make the dish.With improved service, The Little Donkey in Montgomery could easily impress."
Little Donkey Mexican Restaurant - Montgomery,2,"First visit to the city. Based on Yelp this was highly recommended. Sat at the bar and was greeted right away.   I have an allergy to capsaicin and told the waitress.  I originally ordered plain chips. Husband ordered beef brisket tacos. And after a lengthy conversation with the waitress (where both my husband and I stayed I had a severe reaction to anything spicy) she highly recommended the fried chicken and potatoes.  He said his was good (lots of food). Well, the fried chicken came out and looked phenomenal!  The potatoes were crispy and golden.  And was it all spicy.  So very hot!  I tried to eat just the inside and just couldn't. Our waitress had all but disappeared.  If you want spicy. This is the place. For me. I was in serious pain for about 4 hours.  It's really frustrating when you try to convey important information yet completely ignored."
Jubilee Seafood,5,"Great seafood, great service. Andrew was our waiter and in my opinion he made the experience very enjoyable. He was always smiling, and not a fake smile, but took real pleasure in explaining the dishes. If I lived in the area, it would surely be my favorite restaurant."
Jubilee Seafood,4,"Jubilee seafood is located in an unassuming building in cloverdale area. I had been recommended to go here by a friend who is from Montgomery and have only heard good things about it. I went for a dinner meeting and service was great despite the large group. I had a house Pinot Grigio to drink and baked oysters for appetizer. Note that the oysters are topped with bacon. They were cooked very well and tasted great. For my meal, I had triggerfish which is topped with butter sauce, mushrooms, and crab meat. Every meal is served with rice pilaf and coleslaw. The fish was very lightly breaded and perfectly cooked, but needed more seasoning in my opinion. I would also love if they offered some type of green vegetable as a side option. Bread pudding for dessert was very good!"
Jubilee Seafood,4,The food here was really good and the service was amazing. We ordered off the special menu and it did not disappoint. The wine was good and the bread budding was delightful! Worth a try if you're in the Montgomery area.
Jubilee Seafood,3,"I went here with high expectations after reading all the rave reviews. But I think this place is just fine. It certainly has a great cozy feel. But I'm thinking that there aren't a lot of great places to eat here, so this place stands out for that. But for out of towners who are used to bigger and fancier, this place could be a disappointment. While my father-in-law seemed pleased, my husband and I thought it was simply fine. Also, know that when it comes to the one steak on the menu, they only offer rare, medium or done. I ordered rare because you never know what you're gonna get. It arrived not quite done enough for my tastes and they happily cooked it a little longer. But even then it came back quite rare. I gave my husband the particularly bloody bits while I stuck to the edges."
Jubilee Seafood,3,Came here because of the many five star reviews. I ordered the halibut. It was mushy and tasteless. The slaw that was with it was overpowering and sour. The iceberg lettuce wedge that I had before dinner was a few leaves of iceberg lettuce smothered in mediocre blue cheese dressing. On a good note. The service was outstanding. Our waiter was attentive without being hovering and did an excellent job. My dinner guest had the salmon and loved it. The bread pudding was OK. I will not be coming back
Jubilee Seafood,5,"This is one of my favorite seafood restaurants anywhere. Every year on a golf trip, our crew comes in to partake of the delicious seafood and steak entrees that Jubilee offers. Start with the oysters and tuna dip. Get a bowl of seafood gumbo, and then move on to any of the entrees (I've had several and they were all delicious). Ask for the waitstaff's recommendations on food as there may be some seasonal variations. Excellent food, excellent service, reasonable prices."
Jubilee Seafood,5,"We ate here during one of our overnight stays in Montgomery.  This was an excellent find.  The service could not have been better.  The menu was filled with so many delicious choices.  You must try the  Ceaser Salad with crawfish, my husband and I shared that.  Delish.  I had gumbo and my husband had the fried oyster dinner (small).  We were both full when we left there."
Jubilee Seafood,5,Great food. Always. Been here several times.  While the decor needs upgrades the food and service is great.
Jubilee Seafood,4,This was our first time here. While this place is rather small our group of 6 was seated immediately. I had the the Triggerfish was awesome. My husband had the Grouper. Everyone enjoyed their meal! Get there early!
Jubilee Seafood,5,"Tried Jubilee Seafood at the recommendation of a local boutique owner. It was delicious! This place is a simple hole in the wall, but they know seafood and they know how to do it well! My dad had the shrimp remoulade salad and red snapper dinner. I contemplated the same salad but decided I'd had enough vegetables for the day. The salad looked yummy, dad said both salad and dinner were excellent. Mom and I chose to split the smoked tuna dip and both had the steamed shrimp dinner. The smoked tuna dip was just as good if not better than any smoked tuna dip at the beach. The steamed shrimp were perfect! The dinners come with wild rice, a marinated slaw (both good!) and a dinner roll (also good). We tried dessert (at this point why not?). Dad got the homemade key lime pie and I had the white chocolate bread pudding. Mom tasted both and said both were delicious. Next time we visit Montgomery we will definitely be visiting Jubilee Seafood again."
Jubilee Seafood,5,"This was my first visit here. I arrived about 5:45 pm. When I pulled into the parking lot, I was a bit perplexed because from the outside, it seemed like it wasn't even open. You can't see inside from the parking lot. Don't let that dissuade the prospective diner from entering through the door. The atmosphere is casual and family friendly. I ordered the fried crab claws for an appetizer. I had never had these anywhere so I had no idea what to expect. They were lightly breaded and flavored well. Portions on all the food were more than sufficient. For dinner I ordered one of the specials, the Scamp. Plate presentation was nice. Service was fast with no long wait. My food arrived hot. My entree was served with a fantastic coleslaw that is made fresh in house and is not a mayonnaise based soggy goo. It's light and fresh, definitely try it at least once, and rice pilaf. I also tried the fried oysters...of course when I ordered the fried oysters I had no idea I was really ordering another dinner so I ended up with way more food than I could possibly eat! The oysters were large and plump, not like a previous establishment I had visited in the area in the past. They were served with slaw and fries. Nothing remarkable on the fries. All the food was lightly seasoned.  There had been other sauces on the menu but I didn't try any with my meal. Tarter sauce and cocktail came standard. The place really filled up by the time I left but the service did not decline, even when busy. Not only for me but for the other patrons as well. The most significant 'negative' is the price.  It's really a steep mark-up."
Jubilee Seafood,5,"Small, but really special place that treats seafood right.  Fresh, fresh seafood. Nice oysters.Great Gulf fish!  Sauces complement, but don't overpower.  Staff is always attentive.  Gent at bar very knowledgable.  Don't be surprised by a short wait.  It's well worth it.  If really wonderfully prepared seafood is you thing, this is the place.I'm partial to the snapper and red fish.  Red snapper with sauce or almandine are just delightful.  Red fish blacken with chili sauce that is just right for the fish.  The scallops are to die for!My only wish is that I lived closer as it is a treat whenever we can have a meal."
Jubilee Seafood,5,Best food in Montgomery hands down.  All seafood is very fresh.  Place is really old school but don't let that fool you on how good the food is.
Jubilee Seafood,5,"Amazing food!  We are only here for 2 weeks, but will be back before we leave.  The Scamp is superb!"
Jubilee Seafood,3,"On a weekend visit to Montgomery, we visited Jubilee on a Friday night. No reservations accepted and at 6:45 there were no tables available so we decided to sit at the bar.  The chaos was deafening throughout our visit just from too many diners, squeezed into  a very small space with too many tables; the diners were simply talking though it's hard to imagine they could hear one another. The counter offered little respite:  right where we were eating, one young man was shelling oysters, other waiters were sorting their bills .  The manager was pouring wine constantly, while taking calls and barking orders.  The local oysters I ordered on the half shell were  delicious; my husband's  grouper was also tasty. A salad I ordered with feta, watermelon and arugula offered  not much feta ourside of a few crumbs, and smallish fruit pieces, not freshly cut. But I besides agreeing never to eat there again because the atmosphere was so offputting,  we couldn't help noticing how appealing a work place it was for the staff; they looked miserable and didn't act much better: no time to smile or make diners feel welcomed. Couldn't wait to leave!"
Jubilee Seafood,2,"Good food, but not at this price...Upon pulling in the parking lot I met a local who assured me I was in the right place, though I was concerned because the surrounding area and establishment have not fared well over time.Started out with the wedge and watermelon salads . The wedge was standard but the watermelon salad was great! We will try to recreate this one at home.For an entree we each ordered fish and both were good. I ordered the halibut with mushrooms and browned butter sauce and my wife ordered grouper with Parmesan artichoke topping. Both were served with wild rice and cole slaw, and both sides were standard. I added 5 shrimp to make sure I had a good sample, and enjoyed the light cornmeal s&p breading.With the ala carte menu we ended up with a $100 check, which did not really match up with the ambiance or level of food expectations. It was good, but not at that price...I'll look elsewhere on subsequent trips to Montgomery..."
Jubilee Seafood,5,The scamp is absolutely the best seafood fish in the area. Only seafood place in  Montgomery worth spending hard earned money!
Jubilee Seafood,5,Now this is a very nice seafood eatery.  We were visiting from out of town and wanted seafood. We used my YELP app to find seafood restaurants near by and Jubilee came up. When we arrived it looked kind of small which it is. But upon entering it's really nice inside. The waitress was very knowledgeable of the dishes. To my surprise I enjoyed my food! The coleslaw was like no other coleslaw I've tasted. It was delicious!!! The only downfall is. They only open at 5pm.....we discovered this because last weekend we were in Montgomery and wanted to go eat here again. All in all.....great restaurant.
Jubilee Seafood,5,"Fan-freakin-tastic!!!!! Carol was our server she was over the top cool and informative in regards to the menu! We got a dozen oysters and shared the red snapper special. She split plated our food without asking (nice!!!) the fish was the best I have had in a long time. It was served blackened with a cream sauce and a corn salsa. The coleslaw that comes with the dish is more of a sweet vinegar base and not a mayo base ......yum! And the wild rice that accompanies it had mushrooms and also complimented the fish very nicely! I really would have liked to order one of everything in the menu but sadly I was just not hungry enough. This restaurant will be on my ""to do"" list again!!!"
Jubilee Seafood,4,Great seafood in Montgomery with a very local customer feel. The food was outstanding but atmosphere is a little lacking. It appears that the food is taking very serious and atmosphere not so much. Service was also great!
Melt - Huntsville,5,"Who doesn't love a good grilled cheese? This girl LOVES them so when my classmates suggested Melt, I was  % on board. We had party of 12 for lunch and were seated right away. There were so many good options on the menu but j settled on the Mac n cheese grilled cheese and choose the tomato bisque for my side. I'm not sure this could have been any more tasty. I also ordered the fried oreos because why not. While we waited for our food, they had board games on a table near the restroom so I grabbed Connect Four. Fun way to pass the time. One of the guys in my group never got his food and it was quickly rectified and his order was put in. After his order cane out, the chef cake out to apologize for the over site and he wasn't charged. Great food and great customer service! Eat here if you get a chance. I wish we had one where I live."
Melt - Huntsville,3,"On a rare half day off work and helping best friend take care of some errands we found ourselves near downtown and decided to try Melt for the first time. It was a little after 1:00 and we were starving! Melt is a cute, modern restaurant décor-wise and the lunchboxes with napkins, etc., inside are cute, too. The staff were friendly and prompt and helpful. I asked our waiter what he recommended for someone who was not interested in a sandwich or a lot of bread (trying to watch the carbs) and he suggested the chicken flatbread for me. I also had a glass of pinot grigio (they offer one type of pinot grigo and I thought the price was very steep at 11.00/glass), and ice water. The ice cubes are seriously huge ya'll - I digress.Best friend ordered the basil tomato soup and maybe a side salad, I don't recall.I do have pictures to upload at some point.For me, personally, the two cheeses on the chicken flatbread were way too rich and were just too heavy on my stomach. Because of the melted nature of the cheese, peeling some of it off really wasn't an option. I would recommending picking one cheese vice the two they offer if you order this dish - then again, maybe it is just me.Friend enjoyed her soup, and the decor - modern yet not loud like so many places. If they offered a more substantial wine selection (I don't drink beer or liquor), I could see this being a fun place for happy hour on their patio (again cute set up on the patio).Anyway, thanks Melt for friendly service and a cute establishment!"
Melt - Huntsville,1,"I am from Birmingham where the original Melt was founded so I know how this place should be and what it could be. We were visiting my mother and I wanted her to experience what we love - Melt!We arrived before the big lunch crowd  today and we were seated at a large community table and I asked the server if there was a 4 top available.I love community but was not feeling like chatting with others at this time.Hostess stated that she was seating us ""where she knew there were servers"". I told her I totally understand.She was WRONG. There were no servers coming to our table. We watched 5 tables over 10 minutes get seated around us with immediate service. I got up and went to the hostess and told her we had no sever. She said she would take care of it. Again we waited.After another few minutes and more servers walking past us - completely ignoring us- we left. My hubby tried to get a manager but was told they had to go find him? Hell no -we aren't waiting anymore with a hungry 10 year old whining.This Melt location was open last July so I would think that they would be on it.... bending over backwards to show Huntsville what Melt is all about.... but they weren't and it made me sad .We went next door to Oshi poke bowl and sushi and were treated liked family. They know customer service and good food which I will tell you all about in another review."
Melt - Huntsville,3,"I called in my order for curbside pick up and was so excited to try this new place out. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and fries cooked hard (and I made sure that they understood that I wanted my fries cooked harder than the usual). I am a breastfeeding mom and had my babe in the car so I was excited about not having to get out of the car, the young lady that brought me my food was very nice and made the process easy with them being in a tricky location downtown. Upon starting to Eat my food in the car, I was very disappointed when I bit into my first fry... IT WAS ACTUALLY WARM, ALMOST COLD EVEN. I was too frustrated and disappointed to wast time with trying to go back due to now having a crying and unhappy baby in the car."
Melt - Huntsville,4,"I loved Melt in Birmingham and was so excited when I learned one was opening here.  Unfortunately, I don't go downtown too often, so it took me quite a while to make my way here.  Luckily, they recently started offering trivia here, and my family loves trivia, so we have an excuse to go!After two visits with large parties, I have several observations, most of them positive.  The restaurant is really cute inside and fairly spacious, with good options for indoor or outdoor seating.  The sound system is good, and all the tables and the floor have been clean.  Overall, the food is quite tasty.  As you could probably guess from the menu, the food does tend to sit a little heavy on your stomach, but it tastes great going in!  I've tried the Mac Melt (a grilled cheese with macaroni and cheese filling) and the regular grilled cheese.  Most menu options here are sandwiches of some sort, FYI!  They do offer a few salads; the buffalo chicken salad was highly recommended to me by another member of our party.  We also really like the thick, juicy hamburgers (on Texas toast!), the Mac and Egg rolls, and the tomato soup.  The fries are delicious with their house made ranch, too.  We didn't love the Chicken Bleu flatbread (too heavy on the bleu cheese, even for those of us who like it).  The food truck nachos were also meh; I don't think kettle chips hold up as well as regular tortilla chips considering the toppings they loaded them with, although the kettle chips are good on their own!  Minus those two dishes, we've been quite happy with the food.The shining star so far, though, has actually been the service!  Incredibly pleasant, prompt, and extremely organized, despite our quite large party.  Both gentlemen who've waited on us kept our drinks well-filled and were super polite and accommodating for all our needs.  Kudos to them!My two small complaints are sort of related to each other -- the price is maybe a liiiiiittle high for the serving size and the type of food you're getting.  It's around 11 bucks for a plain grilled cheese and some French fries.  And my second complaint:  the French fry servings are a little skimpy (again, for the price).Still, mostly minor in the face of really tasty food, a fun environment, and great service.  We'll be back!"
Melt - Huntsville,4,Stopped in for lunch with my man candy and we were pleased. The place is bright open and inviting. I imagine it's a good time with friends and drinks. The food was good and came out quick. Honestly though the best part was our waitress Brooklyn she was so dope! You could tell she was happy to work their which in turn equates to excellent service.
Melt - Huntsville,4,"Stopped here for lunch (about 30 minutes after they opened) before our visits to the space and rocket center based on reviews. Cool location, very friendly service and out food was out in less than 10 minutes.  Food was very fresh and tasted good. I had the ragin' Cajun which was marked as a spicy sandwich. The chicken was very fresh and had Cajun seasoning with a hint of spice, but i would not call it ""spicy"" at all. The slaw on the sandwich was also fresh, but not particularly tasty. I enjoyed the sandwich but was hoping for a bit more in the flavor department.  I had kettle chips with my sandwich, but I tried one of my daughter's fries and they were fantastic, recommend the fries for sure!Overall, great concept and interesting menu. If I weren't from out of town I'd definitely come back to try more items from the menu."
Melt - Huntsville,4,"Couldn't wait to try this place! Went in on the Friday of opening week. Wait time was manageable for a lunchtime crowd. I didn't have any time constraints. Plenty of activities and space to sit outside if inside waiting is full. Server was prompt and took orders quickly. We already knew what we wanted (party of two). Food came really quickly. Biggest issue: My food came incorrectly. *wanted a simple bacon cheeseburger with meat and cheese, regular came with two patties asked for just one. Server said to get the party melt and add bacon...I obliged. Patty melt came out regular. Friend started to eat her lunch and my replacement burger came out with correct cheese so knew it was fresh but had lettuce pieces all over it. They scraped the toppings off (onions for sure). As someone with a highly sensitive taste of food currently. Onions ruined my burger, Picked around it. Have to be careful with just picking stuff off. Never know who's food allergy table you are servAlso  asked for well done and loaded with pink parts, again can't eat pink meat currently. The pros: the sandwich pieces I was able to eat were very tasty. Fries were delicious, food was hot, service was pretty good. Will I be back? Of course, will be pretty specific in getting burger cooked without onions and WELL done. Husband can't wait to try this place. He ate my leftover and loved it. ***second trip***Went back a week later with a large group on a Friday night. This time two little as in two. Hour long wait which was fine we expected it. Kids played outside and time wasn't terrible. They ran out of pork for nachos but husband was very pleased with them with chicken. He said he would prefer chicken over pork. Win for him. My sandwich was made perfect. Got the regular burger and two patties would have been huge. One was plenty. Kids devoured food. Salads are HUGE! Service was good."
Melt - Huntsville,4,"First thing first, the food here is great! My husband had a patty melt with two patties, he added one, which I suggest since the patties are thin. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich. Both items were great and filling. We will definitely be back! Another positive thing was the service, our waitress India was amazing. When I questioned her about the heat level of the Buffalo sauce instead of just telling me she brought out a little with a fry for me to try; mind you without me asking. They did great of busing our table as we finished our plates. However, the hostess seemed to be struggling and her male helper wasn't much better; they need one to take the names and another to seat. We were texted our table was ready, went up front, told them, and they were overwhelmed by the people at the door and ignored us. They promptly sat two other two tops that had just put their name on the list before us; which was annoying since they both got their own tables but we were given a picnic table with another family. Last thing try the Nutella dessert but skip the Oreos. The manger even replaced ours but when my husband went to eat the new ones on the way home two of the three didn't have Oreos, just dough balls! Overall though a def place to go and enjoy! I can't wait for the fall to enjoy their patio."
Melt - Huntsville,4,"A visit to Melt is a treat for both the casual eater and the food fanatic. The myriad ways they are able to present cheese is astounding. From the honey baked goat cheese to the buffalo chicken sandwich, Melt has a dish for any mood and any occasion. I started with the honey baked goat cheese and mac and egg rolls. The sweet tones of the honey and strawberry exquisitely complimented the creaminess of the goat cheese. The egg rolls were cooked to perfect crispness, leading to a wonderful texture of soft interior with a crunchy shell. The chili glaze dipping sauce served with it accented the flavors to give us a wonderful start to our meal. For the main entree, I had the buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. The Texas toast bread was nicely crisped to give the sandwich some structure, and a nice butteriness. The chicken was well fried, and coated with a nice helping of Monterey Jack cheese. Their homemade ranch doesn't bring anything new to the table, but it is a tasty dipping sauce with a delicate flavor. The mac and cheese is a very good reason to patronize Melt. With a top layer of melty goodness, this dish will hold your tastebuds full attention from start. I will order this every time I eat here. To top off this wonderful experience, their bar is nothing to complain about. With select craft beers on draft, classic domestic options, and house crafted cocktails, their will be a beverage choice suitable for everyone. I can wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone, and I will be back here again very soon."
Melt - Huntsville,4,Very cute decor and great vibe. Food was tasty and service was good. Overall no complaints will visit again.-Chicken Pesto w/fries-Patty Melt w/tomato basil soup
Melt - Huntsville,5,This place is outstanding for lunch. If I could add stars I would. Went there on 28 Aug 19 had the following meals. Goat Cheese with strawberry and walnuts with buttered toast. Delicious never had goat cheese but wow love iRajen Cajun chicken wow wow wow must have.  The roasted turkey was good too.   We ate so much of the Goat Cheese we could not finish the sandwiches    Will return with friends. Excellent Food. Returned on 2 Sept 2019  and the food was even better then the first visit.
Melt - Huntsville,5,"My food was SO. GOODT. I had the Mac N Egg Rolls, beer battered fries & the Patty Melt, and I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED my food. Btw, I suggest getting ranch with your fries. Since this place is new, it's pretty crowded, so if you have a group, you'll probably have a wait. BUT ITS WORTH IT! It's a cute place, and you definitely need to try it! I am going to go here at least once a month."
Melt - Huntsville,4,First time to go to melt and had a largeGroup of 24 people. Called about setting a place for us and they were very low key and said come on down. Got there and everything was set up just like we wanted. Super friendly people and servers we're on the spot. Miles and CJ did a great job taking care of us. The appetizers came out quick and were good. We ordered dinner and the kitchen delivered our meals in a very good amount of time. All is all a good  friendly place to come! Thanks
Melt - Huntsville,5,"This place is twice as big as the original restaurant in Birmingham. Thats a good thing and is the result of Melt's success in Birmingham. Melt started as a food truck, and was so wildly popular, they were able to get finding for a restaurant. That restaurant is great, and the menu is the same in Birmingham and Huntsville. The problem with the Birmingham restaurant is that it's too small. The Huntsville restaurant is stylish and modern, well lit, with a fancy bar that can serve outside and inside. This is an improvement to the Birmingham restaurant, which was built on a much lower budget, and always has a line at lunch and dinner. This place is great and highly recommended. The basic philosophy of the restaurant is built on the classic grilled cheese sandwich. Take that favorite and add various meats and other flavors. My personal favorite is the Flyin' Hawaiian, which is ham and pineapple. The sandwiches are all great, and the mac and cheese is also very good. They serve various beers that I am not qualified to evaluate."
Melt - Huntsville,3,"Melt is an interesting name. The decor, music and style doesn't really fit a sandwich joint. Can't tell if it's for families or young adults. It's like it's looking for an identity. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Our waiter new the menu and could explain things well. So dinks; sodas come in a 12oz plastic cup with ice cubes 4X there normal size. After 4 swigs I needed a refill. The price for soda drinks aren't bad, $2 but not posted on the menu. I got the Mac n cheese egg rolls. They were good but $8 for 2 rolls.. a little much. I got the amigo sandwich which was listed as spicy and it was not spicy at all.  My spice meter did not go off. Meaning I did not have to scratch my head. Lol I did like the flavor and I will have it again. The fries were good as well. However $15 for a sandwich fries and drink is a little much. After said and done with tip for my wife and I it was a $40 meal."
Melt - Huntsville,5,"Really convenient location. Love the food, and the service was great. Seating was a little tight but overall a very enjoyable experience."
Melt - Huntsville,2,"Been 3 times so far... not exactly terrible.The service has been spotty (servers seem to be stressed out) and the quality hasn't been consistent for me.  Funny enough, I've tried three melty sandwiches and they have been my least favorite items from the menu. The ""three way something or the other"" sandwich promised to be spicy with chorizo but was pretty bland. Soggy bread seems to be an issue, because I've experienced it on all three trips.Their fried pickles are decent and I really loved their chef salad. Fried oreos are, um,  fried oreos I guess? I feel this place is more novelty than quality."
Melt - Huntsville,5,Had a great time there with my grand nuggets.  The food choices were great.  The pesto chicken grilled cheese was the best.  Then we ordered a surprise!   Their fried OREO'S!!!  Oh my oh my!!!Delicious.  Having the games at the table and the corn hole game outside made it worth the wait.  Very family friendly!
Melt - Huntsville,4,"Good Beyond burgers with a side of delicious beer-battered fries. It comes with one pickle (a large slice), lettuce, tomato, and American cheese, but we substituted vegan cheese. Excellent, attentive service. Nice ambience with a wonderful outdoor bar and seating area."
Fresko Grille,5,"Fantastic. Fresh. Well seasoned. Great customer service. Ordered take out this evening, and the portions are solid, absolutely delicious. If you like fresh, authentic, mediterranean food, this place rocks it hard. Solid meal."
Fresko Grille,5,I love it. Probably my favorite place in Stovehouse. It's like a chipotle but better and with Mediterranean flavors. I can't tell you what I get bc I try a different combination every time. But I always get the tazikis and garlic sauce. The staff is super friendly and willing to make suggestions and explain what something is. This is great bc they have so many options! My mom recommends the lentil soup! And she is picky. This place is a great way to switch up taste buds and try something different. HIGHLY Recommend trying.
Fresko Grille,4,"My new workplace is close to Stovehouse, so I got a chance to come visit during my lunch break on Thursday.  Been wanting to try Fresko Grille since it opened; overall, I was very happy with my experience.As others have mentioned, this restaurant is very much like a Mediterranean Chipotle.  You select a bowl or a wrap and fill it up with whatever toppings you like.  There's a pretty large selection available! I opted for a Chicken Shawarma Bowl.  My base consisted of basmati rice.  The toppings I chose:  carrots, chickpeas, tomato and cucumber salad, red pepper hummus, tzatziki sauce, and a garlic sauce over my chicken (per the recommendations of the gentleman plating my food).The staff was incredibly pleasant; they welcomed me, explained the process, provided tasty recommendations, and as I checked out, the woman working the register asked if it was my first time visiting.  I said yes, and she said, with the sincerest smile, that she really hoped I enjoyed it.  And I did!  The red pepper hummus was faintly (very faintly) spicy, all the vegetables were cool, fresh, and clean tasting, and the chicken was flavorful, tender, and moist.  It paired perfectly with the garlic sauce!  My only small criticism was the bowl was maybe a little too wet/soggy in some parts.  I'll just have to experiment with toppings more!I did think the price was a little high for lunch (~$14 for the bowl and a soda), but the portions were very generous -- easily enough for two people, so maybe I'll bring a friend and split something next time.  Fresko Grille will definitely get my repeat business!"
Fresko Grille,5,"Wow! Great fresh flavors. Heaping portions. High quality. This was our first time trying Fresko Grille so we got a sampling of various items and shared. Chef Abrahim is a genius. These are new, highly appealing tastes found no where else in Huntsville. Great pita bread. Terrific sauces. Everything tasted wholesome and fresh. I'm a real complainer when comes to eating out. I don't like the way a lot of restaurant eating makes me feel afterwards. Eating at Fresco makes you feel healthy and satisfied like you had all your veggies, fiber, protein, tried something new, ate like a foodie, and still feel like a million bucks.We actually had a hard time finding the place--it's in the North East section of the Stove House. Park on the East side (back entrance). Eat here. Go often. I want this place to stay open!"
Fresko Grille,3,"3.5 starsThe ingredients here are really delicious. I've only been once but I feel like you could have any combination of ingredients and your meal would be delicious. I got a wrap with beef meatballs (that's not what they're called but I don't remember the name. Basically beef and seasonings in an oblong shape), traditional hummus, brown rice, pickled turnips, Kalimantan olives, onion, tzatziki, some other sauce the guy said was good, and a side of chickpea salad. The flavors were really very good. The problem was the wrap. I saw a hot press at the end of the line so I thought they'd warmThe wrap first like they do at burrito places, but they didn't. The wrap was cold and hard and difficult to bite through, so every time I took a bite, all my ingredients were pushed out and it made a huge mess. I kept eating, obviously, because the stuff inside was good, but the wrap really wasn't. I recommend getting a bowl instead. The guys are really nice and friendly as well."
Fresko Grille,3,"For me FG did not deliver.  I got a bowl of stuff atop a bed of lentils and it was flavorless. The sweet lady checking me out (subway style) rang me up as cash when I planned to use credit.  No big deal I complied, and paid with cash. The food was not flavorful and the options are confusing because some staff were unable to project their voices in their various areas to describe your options.  I think they would benefit from a comment/suggestion card.My hummus that I clearly saw the staff plop on my bowl vanished, it couldn't have melted - I seriously do not know how it disappeared. There was an issue with the pita I bought as an add-on. I think she toasted it. Anyway there was no hummus to dip the pita in anyway. Sadly my friend and I dumped our leftovers in the trash. It was not inedible. Just not bursting with Greek flavor. Hoping your experience is different.  Also suggest they offer some Greek wines; they only have a soda machine and tea for beverage options."
Fresko Grille,5,"I recommend this establishment with high regards and will be returning!The level of consideration for those who have dietary restrictions and/or for those who are committing to a healthier lifestyle is commendable. Check out their detailed menu which contains keto, paleo, vegetarian, gluten free, and paleo options!"
Fresko Grille,4,"I love getting food here. The food is fresh and delicious. Keep in mind that this is not a Greek place. It is a Mediterranean place that just happens to carry some Greek choices. I love the baba ghanoush, tabouleh, the pickled onions, pickles turnips, radishes... I just don't feel guilty after eating here. I like topping everything off with the lemon tahini sauce which just makes it solid. The staff is nice and courteous. Oddly enough, the sweet tea here is superb. It is smooth in flavor and not bitter like other establishments that use the automatic tea makers that end up with over steeped tea. The reason for deduction in star is because the kafta is cold and when you total everything together with a drink, you're looking at $12."
Fresko Grille,5,"I've been waiting for this place to open and when it did, I excitedly tried it. I was not disappointed. It was delicious. I ordered a bowl with a brown rice and romaine lettuce base. I chose chicken as my protein and then added toppings: tabouli, tzatziki, tomatoes and cucumbers. I've gone twice so I've tried two different combos of dressing with this bowl. The garlic and ranch are great together, as is the ranch and vinaigrette. Lastly, I get a drizzle of olive oil on top. I ordered some pita bread to go with this meal. It was amazing. All the flavors go so well together and I love how you can customize your dish to be whatever you want it to be.My only issue is that I have to ask for extra dressing because they use very little. And they charge quite a bit more than the usual. Four 2oz dressings on the side (two bowls were ordered) were $7.80 before tax. That's extremely high. Other than this one issue, I love this place.The restaurant was clean and is in a good location. I will definitely be going back and recommending it to others."
Fresko Grille,5,"great little place tucked away in an awesome little spot. there's ample outside seating as well as some good music. the food is delicious and with the build your own method, everyone can get something they like. I really recommend their baklava's! they use a technique I haven't seen at any other mediterranean restaurants that keeps the baklava moist. had a delightful conversation with the employee while i was waiting in line for more baklava's! the employees were informative and very nice. I really enjoyed how they gave recommendations for flavor combos! if you're thinking about trying something different or trying to get some stubborn friends out of their food comfort zones, definitely try it out!! (or at the very least just get the little baklava's...)"
Fresko Grille,5,"I was excited to try the new Mediterranean restaurant at Stovehouse. To see tradition Mediterranean food being served in Alabama made my heart happy. To taste the authentic flavors made my soul sing.  You walk into a very modern concept; pick a bowl or pita sandwich. Choose your base; rice, mix greens or spinach. You then choose your protein; beef or chicken shawarma, kafta or falafel. You continue on to a beautiful assortment of salads and toppings. From traditional Tabbouleh to Spicy Hummus. Most are plant based. All are delicious!  The falafel was crispy on the outside with a nicely spiced center. The Kafta perfectly charbroiled & moist. The Shawarma, ohhh the Shawarma! A wonderful mix of spices give the meat it's authentic taste. The cooking method of using a spinning grill gives its delicious grilled flavor. The service was excellent! We were kindly greeted upon entering & the staff was eager to explain menu items to us. This is a great restaurant to grab a quick, tasty & healthy meal to-go or better yet, stay for the ambiance."
Fresko Grille,5,"Wow! Imagine chains like Cava or Mezze and kick it up a notch! Casual and speedy build-a-bowls and pitas. Huge selection of toppings---all fresh and tasty. They even have guidelines for specific diets... Even keto!They don't have a formal option for ""double protein"" yet but I suspect they'll catch on soon :)"
Fresko Grille,5,"Had a great experience here today! I ordered the chicken shawarma bowl. The menu is fully customizable and you can pick the ingredients (sauces, vegetables etc) that you want- think Chipotle. The food was very fresh and flavorful. Service was quick and friendly. No crowd inside on Sunday at lunch time. Plus, Stovehouse is just a really cool venue with great ambiance. Had a great time and would definitely come back!"
Fresko Grille,5,"We've eaten here twice and really enjoyed it both times, there are a lot of choices to make and I think I'll like it even more when I know exactly what to order. Falafels are good, chicken is even better.What I think would make it even better: options listed on the glass as you go down the line, trays and more pickled topping options"
Fresko Grille,4,"This is a new offering in the Stovehouse complex, which is a great open-air food hall with what will eventually be about 25 restaurants and shops.  This is one of the first to open, and I'm glad it's here.  You don't find much of this sort of food around here, but it's solid.  You build your own bowl or wrap, customizing it with your choice of protein and veggies, then top it with a sauce.  We have places like this in Denver, where I live, and it's a pretty good comparison.  They might eventually have to pare down the options, because it can be overwhelming if you've never tried this style of Mediterranean food.  But it was fresh, tasty, and inexpensive, so I'm a fan."
Fresko Grille,3,"As everyone has already mentioned, this is a fast-casual Mediterranean spot in Stovehouse that operates very similar to Chipotle. The staff was incredibly friendly, and helpful, and gave suggestions and descriptions as you worked your way down the line navigating the different options. I ordered a bowl with basmati rice, half beef kabob, half falafel, carrots, pepperoncinis, quinoa cucumber tomato salad, tzatziki, hummas, and hot sauce. Most of it tasted good, but the falafel was very dry and hard (maybe old?) and the beef also seemed like it was cooked well before I ate it. I probably fell victim to coming after the lunch rush (about 1:30) and did not have the freshest of options, which I believe led to the experience I did. I definitely will be back to give it another shot, because everything else tasted fresh. I hope I just came at the wrong time."
Fresko Grille,3,"Nothing to brag about. Not much flavor, not so hot and not so fresh. By design, it's basically up to the customer to select and mix a bunch of ingredients that most can't even identify. If you're going to offer authentic Mediterranean cuisine...it might help too actually offer some traditional combinations we can ask for instead of us having to rely on our own culinary creativeness."
Fresko Grille,4,"Great for a light lunch.  They had me at tabouli.  Got the chicken shwarma bowl with romaine and spinach, tabouli and cilantro hummus.  The flavors meshed perfectly.  Loved it.  The Stovehouse area is a nice spot too.  I need to visit at night to see the vibe.  Huntsville is on the rise....."
Fresko Grille,5,"What a great grill and the location is great as well!!! We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and sat outside at a table and people watched.  I didn't expect it to be a location like campus 805, but really enjoy what they are doing to revitalize the old town vibe.  I had a bowl with beef shawarma which I hadn't had since I was in Kuwait 10 years ago."
Fresko Grille,5,"Located in Stovehouse with great music in the evenings. Great atmosphere. The 5 stars are for the great falafel and baklava. The rice had over-cooked chunks in it; the chicken wasn't marinated enough. The tabouli and cucumber salads were great, as was the babaghanouj. I would go again just for the falafel and baklava."
Cotton Row Restaurant,5,"I'd heard mixed reviews about CottonnRow, but we decided to give it a go for an early Valentine's Day celebration. We were VERY pleasantly surprised. We were seated in the wine cellar - a lovely, private-ish room with only two other tables. The atmosphere was cozy and romantic, and service was exceptional. We each started with the crab cakes (best I've ever had!). Great flavor coupled with a delicious butter lettuce salad. This was followed by the filet mignon for my husband, and short ribs for me. Again - very nicely prepared, great flavor and melt in your mouth tenderness. For dessert - the heart shaped raspberry gelee for me, the choc/caramel torte for him. We shared, which was perfect. Our server was on top of everything, plates arriving perfectly timed, drinks filled and all our comforts ensured. We now have our go-to restaurant for special occasions. Cotton Row was perfect!"
Cotton Row Restaurant,2,"Have been to Cotton Row a few times before, and always enjoyed the experience, particularly the food, which has never let me down. However, my Valentine's experience left A LOT to be desired for several reasons, but I think can be summed up into the logistical nightmare that is the second floor. To be clear, the food was just about excellent, as always is the case for Cotton Row, but the service and confusion that we experienced really turned the night into a mess. For starters, when we sat down they did not have a wine / cocktail list since all others were occupied. No problem, but when we did put in our drink orders, I received my cocktail, then appetizers, then my date's wine (about 45 minutes after we were seated) and then bread, all at about 10 minute intervals. Talking with my table neighbors, this didn't seem unique to us. They were comped at least one round of drinks at the end of the night due to the slow service and incorrect order placements. Other things seemed off as well: my server didn't know beers on draught, or bourbons available for an Old Fashion, although admittedly this wasn't necessary information if enough drink lists were available.Several other requests we asked for (a knife, since one fell on the floor) and a coaster to fix the severe imbalance on our table, for example, were not fulfilled. I was told, weirdly, that they could not fix the table for us since they were rented for the evening, which I thought was pretty weak.We also were incorrectly brought the wrong dishes at least twice, so clearly something strange was going on with the table arrangements they had that night. As we were leaving, I realized the second floor was entirely separated from the restaurant, requiring the dishes to be run to the second floor entrance from the outside. I think this led to a lot of the problems in coordination between food runners, waiters and the bar staff. Bottom line, please don't sit people upstairs if you can't handle the traffic, logistics and increased crowd size. It wasn't even close to being worth the $240 tab for a night of confusion and unfulfilled requests. Will I be coming back? Maybe, but not anytime soon..."
Cotton Row Restaurant,4,"I'd give it a 4.5 if I could.  The restaurant was beautiful, the menu had select items, but a great variety, the wine list was awesome and the desserts were amazing.  We had a great server too.The half star is for the braised ribs being very salty (saw this in other reviews, but needed to try for myself). They were very tender and sat on a small bed of smoked/bbq-ish/jus grits.  Texture of everything was perfect.  I also ordered the molton lava cake, but there was no lava just cake, so the server exchanged it for the toffee cake which was similar to lava cake but much sweeter.  My total bill was $44 for just the entree and dessert so plan to spend over $60 to include tip and a drink (no tastes or starters included).  This is a great restaurant and we'd probably return, but only after we visited a few more options near the area.  For a nice evening, try it out!  You won't be disappointed. :)"
Cotton Row Restaurant,5,The best Restaurant to enjoy a great meal and relaxation.The food and drinks are outstanding.
Cotton Row Restaurant,2,"We recently moved to the area and were told by many people that this place is a ""must try"". We have now gone on two occasions and were extremely underwhelmed. On our first visit, one of our dishes was was inedible due to saltiness. The other dish was fine. For $32ish a plate, fine isn't good enough and excessive saltiness is something that can easily be avoided. The rest of our experience was ""fine"", but nothing outstanding for the cost.We decided to give it another try last evening and sat at the bar. This was 8:30 on a Saturday night and the restaurant was maybe 30% full at most. The entire staff appeared frantic, as if the restaurant was packed. It took far too long for us to even get water and be able to order our food for the ratio of staff to patrons, during which time we decided it was not worth it to attempt to order a full meal. We got two appetizers, which to be fair, were very good. The bartender was also extremely friendly. This unfortunately was not enough to compensate for the perplexing chaos around us.This place seems to be surviving on reputation alone .It seems as if Huntsville is undergoing a lot of development and soon there will be many more options in the area. It needs to take a look at itself and revamp if it is going to stay competitive as more restaurants open in this growing area."
Cotton Row Restaurant,4,"I always read the negative reviews first on Yelp.  The valentines day guy has a point but ""ryan"" is out to lunch... or maybe it was dinner.  He doesn't know.Cotton Row is shockingly good.  Inspired, well crafted dishes from a professional Chef who most definitely knows how much salt to put on food.  Recommend the halibut.  I ordered it on a whim but was incrementally better than the short ribs and grouper.  Which is to say all three dishes were excellent.  Don't miss the Tuna starter.The barman knows his business and is most handy with the cocktails.I'll be back..."
Cotton Row Restaurant,3,"Cotton Row has been an established restaurant in Huntsville for a long time now and I feel like their brunch should be on point every time for such a prime downtown location. Our food took over an hour to come to our table, which our waiter was very apologetic about, but by the time our food arrived my eggs benedict was lukewarm and we had filled up on biscuits because we were starving.I think our waiter was great, and did a good job checking on us, and I'm sure the kitchen was slammed, but for how much you are paying, the food should be excellent every time."
Cotton Row Restaurant,5,Best brunch in Huntsville!! Many great options $5 Mimosas and greats service as always!
Cotton Row Restaurant,5,"This is an innovative restaurant serving delicious dishes in a fine dining manner with American Southern sophisticated charm. Talented chef, amazing menu, friendly and attentive staff. Priced appropriately for the creative, unique fare.  I have returned here on every visit to Huntsville, AL and will again."
Cotton Row Restaurant,5,"Nice place in the down town area. They have plenty of street parking and also have valet. This was my Friday time coming. Staff were welcoming and friendly. We came on a weekend evening and it wasn't too crowded. We ordered several appetizers. We had the the fries, fried oysters, butternut ravioli, and the cheese board. My family quite enjoyed the cheese board, fried oysters, and the butternut ravioli were delicious. The fries were basic and came with a homemade sauce. I ordered the grilled pacific salmon which was nice and seasoned well. It came with a sauce. Service personnel were attentive to our needs and the portions were not large, however with the appetizers it was filling. I have no recommendations for dessert we declined having our eye bigger then our stomachs. I recommend this place and it seems to be the only fine dinning experience I have noticed in Alabama. Hope they can establish more places."
Cotton Row Restaurant,2,We were told by friends that this is a must place to go ! so on a very rainy evening on our last day in Huntsville we made reservations I was so disappointed when we were seated we were served stale rolls they did bring fresh but that should not ever happen Very small menu The salad 7 wonder was good $11Soup good $10Salmon had a kick ok not great $29?the onion that can with it were good Small portions Told hostess it was out anniversary when we arrive Waiter was not told he said then a hostess came over with a glass of champagne that was a nice touch but a little to late The dinner was ok not great not worth recommending or returningThis was a very over price restaurant
Cotton Row Restaurant,4,"The restaurant has pleasant ambience. Like many other reviewers have mentioned the service is a bit slow but just in the beginning. It takes awhile to eventually get the  menu but the server is quite attentive after that. It could be design that they want you to feel relaxed? We had the cheese board which had abundant variety of palate cleansers. Wished they had skipped the cheddar and replaced with a soft cheese. The seafood chowder, Black Truffle Tagliatelle Pasta, and filet mignon were all delicious. Only disappointment was lobster mac and cheese which was cold. The dark chocolate caramel crunch cake was amazing."
Cotton Row Restaurant,4,"Love the ambience, easy southern style and hospitality! Great for shrimp and grits and awesome fried green tomatoes. I often stop here with my girl friends to just chill on busy Friday evenings. A great place to hand out and enjoy wonderfully crafted dishes. Good wine selection at reasonable prices! Good for a romantic rendezvous. Valet parking."
Cotton Row Restaurant,4,"A tale of two venison - I came here on a Tuesday night, it was slow and I got a table right away.  I ordered the venison with an appetizer and glass of wine.  Best meal I'd had in ages; there were plenty of vegetables, cooked to the perfect texture, and the mean was tender, flavorful, and rich with flavor.  Blew my doors off.Then on Friday, I came here after striking out at another restaurant (1 hour wait).  I sat at the bar; it was busy.  My order took a long time to come out - long enough that I got the impression someone dropped (forgot) the order.  The bartender was nice and gave me a free drink.  The venison finally came out, and while it was definitely a good meal, it tasted rushed - very few vegetables, the meat was slightly burned on the outside and slightly under-done on the inside.  I found all the staff to be friendly and conscientious.  So my recommendation is to come here, but on a weeknight where the tempo is slower and the kitchen has more time to work their magic."
Cotton Row Restaurant,2,"I live in Tokyo away from my wife and son and I was home for the holidays. I made reservations for New Years Eve and looked forward to having a nice dinner with my wife and son whom I miss very much.We show up at the appropriate time and they tell us that our table isn't ready, so we had to wait for almost half an hour. There was no place to sit down so we just had to stand in a little corner by the hostess stand.Finally after almost 30 minutes, the hostess took us to our table, which was upstairs. Strangely, she took us through the back through the kitchen itself and then walked us outside in the rain to a staircase to get to our table in a completely different section of the restaurant. I found this odd.After we were seated, it took about 15 minutes for the server to bring us some water when there were only a few other guests sitting around us in the upstairs section of the restaurant. At this point I've been in the restaurant for almost an hour and all I've had given to me is one glass of water. I'm starting to get very irritated and my young son is starting to get antsy. This is not how I envisioned our New Years Eve meal to go down.The server finally takes our order. I ordered the filet mignon (ordered to be cooked medium) and lobster tail a for me and my son and my wife got the chicken.Again, we waited almost 35 minutes for our food to arrive, we saw our tray with our food sitting on a counter to be picked up. We watched as it sat there for about 15 minutes with no one bothering to deliver it to our table. We watched as many servers passed by it without looking. At this point we've been in the restaurant for about an hour and fifteen minutes. When we got our food it was COMPLETELY cold and wasn't cooked like I asked. My wife's chicken was so dry that she could not eat it. It was like chewing sawdust.I asked to speak to the manager. I expressed my displeasure to the manager and she made the situation right and comped our meal. The kitchen cooked our meals for the second time and got it right. From entering the restaurant to getting our correct meal took over two hours.The couple that was sitting at the table next to us also had problems with their food and had to send it back as well. The gentleman that spoke to the manager was not pleased. He got cold food as well.I'm glad that Cotton Row comped our meal, but I would have had no problem paying for it if it was done right the first time."
Cotton Row Restaurant,3,"First time here. Got a room on the second floor with a door!  It was cozy but nice. Lemonade was tasty and fresh. Started with apps of fried green tomatoes and fried oysters.  The fried green tomatoes were amazing.  I could've eaten all 6!   The grilled romaine salad was delish.  Nice char flavor.  Balsamic was slightly sweet, parmasean dressing was tasty.  The tomatoes were peeled and oh so good!  One of the best salads I've had!  I got the filet.  I ordered medium and it came medium rare.  It was fine but not my favorite. It was tender and tasty.  The mashed potatoes were good. The greens and sauce a bit heavy handed on the salt.  Overall it was fine but not the best I ever had.  The dessert menu looked amazing but I skipped due to calories. Service was amazing.  Five star service. It was good but definitely a bit pricey.  I would go back for a special occasion."
Cotton Row Restaurant,3,"Great taste of the food but really disappointed with the service. Just because I was wearing shorts, a T-shirt, a baseball hat and because it felt great eating outside, nobody has been paying attention to me and I spent exactly 1h21 there just for a filet mignon and a glass of wine. Once again food was really good, perfectly cooked, and flavors combination were great, but the service is 50% of the experience. I had 5 different servers coming to me, I have been asked 3 times what I wanted, wine was good but still pretty cold out of the cooler... I was really expecting a higher service for this kind of restaurant, no matter how you look!"
Cotton Row Restaurant,5,"Best restaraunt I've been to in a long time!!Service was excellent and very attentive staff. Historic location and building dates in 1800s. State declaration signed next door. This place was a bank and cotton store and downstairs private dining in wine cellar too. Can't say enough about it!! AppsTonight's special was Foi Gras with pressed honey and was carmelized on outside served on macerated cherries! Also had housemade fried green tomatoes on horseradish and hotsauce. Great start!!EntreesI had Colorado rack of lamb that was the best I've had and filet mignon was great too.DessertsHouse special torched phyllo dough filled with peanut butter and jelly was good but the best I had was triple chocolate cake with homemade toffee chip ice cream! Can't wait to return here again!! Beautiful gem in Huntsville with excellent service, food and drinks. Yes it is somewhat pricey but great food costs and is def worth it!"
Cotton Row Restaurant,4,"I'm in town for work this week and I just had brunch at this place. Delicious! I had the fried green tomatoes to start, and wow, they're great! The breading was perfect, never got soggy, and never fell off the tomatoes. The tomatoes themselves were perfectly tangy and the remoulade and hot sauce were an excellent pairing. I got the Maine lobster ravioli for my entree. Soooo good. The cream sauce (with large pieces of shaved black truffle) was so rich and paired perfectly with the ravioli which were stuffed full of sweet lobster. My mimosa was excellent and so was the service! I highly recommend this place."
Cotton Row Restaurant,5,Generous drinks. Delicious appetizers. I had crab cakes and husband had soup. Outstanding!  Friendly!
Char Restaurant,5,"This is our 2nd time coming to Char. The 1st time was just my husband and I, this time it's the family- 2 adults 3 kids- 14, 11, 4. Brunch includes a few breakfast type of items- 4 types of Benedicts, chicken and waffles, french toast, and a couple of others. Lunch menu includes, fish, burgers, salads, and more. Mimosa and bloody Marys for $5. The OJ tastes like it's freshly squeezed. We started off with oysters. They are amazing and went down fast- all the kids loved it. We ordered Char burger, chicken and waffles, Southern Benedict, French toast- they do not have kid sized brunch items- ask for the kids sizes they have. Bread is served at the table. The food is all very good. The French Toast came with 3 large slices of bread and sausage patties, the Benedict came with fruit salad with mint, burger with fries, and chicken and waffles. It all was served hot and fresh. The service is great and we are very satisfied. We will return!"
Char Restaurant,4,"I really enjoyed a recent GNO at Char! The wait staff and food were both top notch! Think of Connors. Connors is a well oiled machine in terms of food quality consistency and excellent unobtrusive service - taken up a notch. The cohesiveness of the staff in both uniform and unobtrusiveness is delightful.  They perch out of range like ball boys and girls at wimbeldon who blend in with their surroundings so as not to be a distraction and before you know it and without realizing it your water glass is tipped off again!Nice! The ambiance is romantically dim steakhouse with candles on each table.  I thought the price point was a little high which is the reason for no 5th star.I had the oysters. And I ordered a half dozen and received a dozen.  They were really good albeit a little salty for my taste.  I wanted to try the redfish (I think it was) but the cheap me passed on it as it was 28$.  Others in my group got it and enjoyed it. I'll splurge next time. The half salad was really good. I got the spring mix maybe (see photos for details).  The noise level was doable, the bar has great specials and the wine list is extensive! And the bathrooms were clean and classy while not being pretentious! I look forward to enjoying the (on this Tuesday evening) bar for HH in the future, where like I said you can get some good prices on eats and drinks. I think the total before tip for half a salad, a dozen oysters and wine was approx. $50.Not one compliant in our party of 7 and some can be really picky! Char, thank you for enriching Huntsville's dining scene - am so glad you're here!"
Char Restaurant,4,"The Drink: A RevolverAppetizer 1: Fried Green Tomatoes Appetizer 2: Crab CakesDesert: Pecan Butter CrunchPros:Crab Cakes- absolutely delicious! Very fresh! All crab and no filler! Good size portion.Fried Green Tomatoes- great seasoning, perfect texture. Not over or under fried.Pecan Butter Crunch- surprisingly good. The name is deceiving. It taste nothing like the name.Staff is extremely friendly! Nothing like great hospitality.Cons:The fried green tomatoes are sliced thin so even though they are tasty...you will not get your moneys worth.Mixed Review:Pecan Butter Crunch- is extremely sweet (is was still wonderful)."
Char Restaurant,5,"This was our first visit to Char Restaurant. I just learned of the restaurant in the last couple of days and it had a very high recommendation who had just eaten there for the first time.It was not a disappointment. The food was excellent. We ate there for a late lunch and there was a menu with options that made it difficult to decide what I should order.I ordered the Free Range Chicken. The meal was well seasoned, the meat was tender and the side dishes (mashed potatoes and green beans) were outstanding.My dining companion had the crab claws. There were also perfectly prepared​.For dessert, we splurged on a twin brownie with ice cream. The brownies were not dry but very moist and chewy. Ice cream was also excellent. It should require at least two people to eat this dessert​ and still leave the table feeling comfortable. The brownies are made at the restaurant and probably worth however many calories are in this dish.The service was excellent. The ambiance was very comfortable. I would have felt comfortable there whether dining in clean blue jeans and a collared shirt or a coat and tie. There is also an excellent wine list--at least for bottled wine. This is one of the best restaurants in Huntsville; it is comparable to the Ruth's Chris restaurant in Twickenham. Both are more expensive than most restaurants in town but the food and atmosphere are also superior so worth the extra money when dining out seems like a good option."
Char Restaurant,5,"Food was absolutely delicious!!! Crab cake appetizer, redfish, NOLA shrimp and filet were all cooked to perfection!"
Char Restaurant,3,"The food here is Decent, the service could be so much better, the server wasn't very attentive and the hostess need to acknowledge their guest a little more"
Char Restaurant,4,"We chose Char for a special birthday dinner.  It's a beautiful upscale restaurant in a sort of new shopping center.  Despite opening several months ago, it's still super busy, even on weeknights.  We tried to make reservations for 6 on a Thursday and there was no space; 6:30 worked out fine, though.  We arrived and were seated promptly.  It's a bit louder in the restaurant than I expected it to be, and we couldn't hear the piano player in the room we were seated in.  That wasn't important to me, but be aware and ask to be seated close by if it's important to you!  The waitstaff was overall quite impressive; it was very cool to watch such a large staff work together so cohesively and efficiently.  Our food came out in an acceptable amount of time.  I wanted it a little sooner but I was starving...I think the short wait was intentional, to encourage me to enjoy the time chatting with my dining companions, but I had had basically nothing to eat so I was ready to go, haha.We were served bread to start along with our salads.  The bread is basically a miniature baguette.  We received three warm baguettes for 7 people.  Splitting them in halves meant one person missed out, which was a shame. Those of us who did get one enjoyed the warm, slightly toasty bread and whipped butter.  All the salads were well received, and I'd say a reasonable size for the $5 up-charge.  I had the 8 oz filet with a loaded baked potato.  Others at the table got a ribeye, prime rib, another filet, pork chops, a salmon dish, and the steak frites.  We also got an order of bacon Brussels sprouts to share.  Those were quite good, though I'm not sure if they were worth  $8.  Perhaps if the serving size had been a bit bigger.  Pretty much everyone enjoyed their food, with the exception of the person who got steak frites.  She thought it was too salty.  In defense of Char, she's extraordinarily picky and sensitive about food, so I wouldn't put a ton of stock in that opinion.  I liked that the baked potatoes were salted on the outside, and they were loaded with toppings.  My filet cut like butter and melted in my mouth.  I don't have a ton of experience with fine dining type places in Huntsville, but I can at least say I prefer Char to Grille 29, and that I had a very positive experience overall.Two small detractors, though.  They forgot the appetizer we ordered (Nola BBQ shrimp) and wouldn't have remembered if we hadn't reminded them.  It was finally brought out when all but maybe one or two of us had cleaned our plates.  Our recompense was, supposedly, some extra shrimp.  Having never had the dish, I don't know if there were actually more shrimp in there than normal or not, but the portion size wasn't too huge.  That was okay considering we were all stuffed anyway, but it was disappointing to not get it in the order we expected.  Secondarily, pretty much EVERY steak was cooked a level below what we asked for (e.g. I ordered medium and got very medium rare; someone else ordered medium-rare and got quite rare).  Thankfully the beef was flavorful and good enough that I didn't mind it being slightly less cooked than I prefer, but I'll keep that in mind when ordering in the future!Overall, I'd say Char is a good choice for a very delicious steak and a lovely dining experience.  An excellent option for a special occasion!"
Char Restaurant,5,"It is as good as everyone says! The bearnaise sauce is amazing! They have ""fresh cut"" frites. My filet was cooked great and was so tender, I could have not used my knife...and our service was excellent!We took our little one, but I recommended NO kids to fully enjoy your mealI didn't get any photos of the food because I was busy enjoying. I have recommended this place to so many people already - just delicious!!"
Char Restaurant,5,"5 stars but is anyone surprised? Superior service, excellent food. I ordered the NOLA BBQ Shrimp and it was delicious. Spicy meets hearty. Voodoo Lady cocktail was also fantastic!"
Char Restaurant,5,"Ok, let me make this short.  No need to lead you on, right to the good stuff.1st I had the smoked Manhattan (don't drink the smoke!!!)....yes!  Great.2nd and last I had the ultimate, decadent, life changing NOLA BBQ Shrimp.  Damn...........That's it.  That's all I can say.  I can still taste it.  I want to taste it again.  I wanted it to never end.  Char, I will be back when I'm back in Huntsville.Go to Char.  Get the NOLA BBQ Shrimp.  Rejoice!"
Char Restaurant,4,"Upscale new steak house in Huntsville Alabama was a a nice find while visiting this ever expanding city. Our party of four were greeted by the soft tones coming from the piano bar. Reservations are strongly advised, as this new 13 week old establishment is quickly acquiring a strong following. Staff could not have been more attentive and knowledgeable of their menu. High ceilings kept the noise level down as this was a busy night. We did have to wait a bit for our drinks which forced us to remind our server but they came right after that and we moved on. First course included: Crab, Shrimp, and Andouille Gumbo which had a deep southern roux which was flavorful and satisfying, however if they kept to tradition some would raise an eyebrow to the mixing of seafood and sausage? But i liked it. Then came the fried Crab Claws that was almost too much on the plate but the spice profile was amazing and not just Old Bay and Cayenne.. Messy and great! Then came the Fried Green Tomatoes, cornmeal-encrusted, tomato relish with comeback sauce. When we saw this we simply had to add it onto the course. Properly cooked, and seasoned and loved the textural aspect along with a creamy rich sauce that played well with the acid forward tomato. The second course was presented: Scallops with roasted red bell pepper risotto, asparagus, thyme roasted grapes, caramelized leek cream which was the star of the evening with every element balanced with each other. Scallops tender and well seared. A delightful plate of food! The Prime Rib was good, happy not see too much fat portioned out correctly but lacking in flavor of what I normally like to see in a Prime Rib slow cooked with an amazing crust. My other guests had requested a bearnaise sauce while I had au jus. Everyone walked away satisfied and will return. The early rise of this property is a good sign and my feeling is it will do very well once the back and front of the house gets into a groove.  On a Side Note: Sorry for not including pictures, as I normally do, of the meal as my cloud was having issues and I lost that trip."
Char Restaurant,5,This place was great!  The food was fabulous and so was the service. Portions were generous. The crab cakes were Devine! My son got the rib eye steak and he said it was cooked perfect. We can't wait to go back!
Char Restaurant,5,"Amazing food, great atmosphere! I love the drinks and the pianist! Char's food is flavorful and fresh!"
Char Restaurant,5,"We went to Char for my birthday dinner and had a fantastic experience! First off, our waitress was attentive and timed the courses perfectly. For a drink, I ordered a Moscow Mule which was outstanding. For an appetizer, we ordered the fried green tomatoes. The sauce that accompanied them had a little kick to it, which I absolutely loved. For my entree, I ordered the filet, which was perfectly cooked, a loaded baked potato, and the lobster tail. Let's talk about the potato for a second, because it was by far the best I have EVER had. The potato was rolled in butter and a coarse sea salt and was just divine (as much as a potato could possibly be). The lobster was fresh and drenched in butter, so of course that was just incredible as well.Char was exactly what I hoped it would be. I can't wait to try their happy hour and Sunday brunch!"
Char Restaurant,5,"Nice, fine dining restaurant!  The food was great!  I also had Brussels Sprouts and crab claws."
Char Restaurant,5,"For only having recently opened, Char in Huntsville is knocking it out of the park!  Fantastic ribeye steak, arguably one of the best ones in town.  Crab cakes and fried green tomatoes were excellent as well.  Old fashion was delicious.  Service was great and atmosphere was nice.  Little loud in there but it just means everyone is having a good time!"
Char Restaurant,5,"Where to begin!  This is what Huntsville has needed!  My husband and I come last night to celebrate our 26th Anniversary, and it was a perfect place.  From the minute you walk through the doors, you are greeted into a unique atmosphere.  We came early so that we could sit at the bar and enjoy a drink before sitting down for dinner.  The live piano in the bar was GREAT!   Tany was our bartender and was so attentive to everyone.  But...all the bartenders were always smiling and engaging with all the other guests and us.  Our reservation was for 7:30 on a Wednesday night, and the place was Poppin!  I couldn't get over how crowded it was and how many people were out trying this amazing restaurant, which makes me so happy.We were seated at a booth, and all the booths seem very private - which I love!!  Keith was our server and let me tell you he was phenomenal!   So...since it's our first time to Char we want to try everything!  We start with the Fried Green Tomatoes with the comeback sauce.  The tomatoes are PERFECT!!!  The crust was perfect, and they were not greasy.  The comeback sauce is so freakin delicious I could eat it with a spoon!  We then ordered our dinners - I ordered the Chicken, and my husband ordered the Duck, and we ordered salads as well - I had the Wedge, and my husband had a Ceaser.   The food isn't rushed here, which I appreciate more than I can even say!!!  So we got our salads, and they were great!  When our entrees came we were WOWED by the presentation first, and then when we had our very first bites...well we were completely won over, and this will be OUR PLACE to come with friends and family and special occasions!  I can't even put into words how great Char is!  And...of course, we finished with the Pecan Butter Crunch and the Double Cut Fudge Brownie - they both were fantastic!I want to discuss the staff and the atmosphere here - and other restaurants need to take note... Char has got it going on!  The experience here lasted almost 3 hours for us - from the moment we walked in we were treated impeccably.   Keith was our server and was amazing and I will be making reservations again in the future and will request him 100%!!!  But, there is a level of care that all the staff shows their guests, and they are not intrusive, they provide knowledge about their food, menu, and even sharing information about Char and the owners without a single ounce of smugness.  I'm so thrilled that Char has decided to add a location to Huntsville, we are so lucky!  I will be back and am so excited to spend another evening enjoying a meal!  RUN to Char and give this place a try, you will not be disappointed! (PS...better make reservations as this place is going to blow up!)  Thank you Char for the best experience!"
Char Restaurant,3,So we went here for our Anniversary and booked on open table where we informed tbem ut was our Anniversary. There was nothing special done for us and that sucked considering people had been saying they are similar to a Ruth Chris situation where for pur Anniversary they have had a rose on the table and provided a cute dessertwith happy anniversaryon it. The prices were fair and the food was ok.
Char Restaurant,4,"This place is so amazing from the Friendly greeting from the hostess and my waiter. The food was mouthwatering delicious delicious  delicious!!!! I shall return. , keep up the good work staff !"
Char Restaurant,5,"Awesome atmosphere, I had the 12oz fillet and wife had scallops. Highly recommended!"
Below the Radar Brewery Co,5,"Below the Radar is a phenomenal little spot in downtown Huntsville. The staff is welcoming and friendly, and the manager knows us and makes sure we feel appreciated. My wife and I and our huskies are always welcome on their patio. The spicy queso is fantastic, and the sesame ginger wings always deliver.Unrelated, where else are you going to find 99 cent mimosas?? On the subject of price, they just started having happy hour from 4-7 (I think?) every day. This is a great place. Come eat their food and drink their beer."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,3,Ok first this place is high priced. But it is well worth the cost. The food is some of the best I have ever had. I got a Reuben and fries. The sandwich was one of best sandwiches ever. Enjoyed every bite. The fries are hands down best fries ever. Servers were quick with my tea refills. No regrets here.  I will be back!!Update. For some reason these jokers changed the Fries from the best ever to the most bland garbage fries I ever had. Took my son and he said these fries are terrible. They were. Please explain why you would go from fries that were different and better then everyone else to regular fries that could not beat anyone else. Get ready to drown some fries in ketchup! Seriously this is embarrassing. Took the five star away and gave it a 3 star. Honestly only reason for 3 star is remembering those awesome fries. If you switch back the fries you will get back the 5 star!
Below the Radar Brewery Co,4,"Decent brewery with a variety of beers, both their's and other brands, on tap. The night I stopped in I tried Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan's Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier (try saying that three times fast sober or not) and enjoyed the beer, the atmosphere, and the staff were friendly.I did check out the food menu and while it looked interesting, it was late at night and I was not overly hungry. The Dixie Burger did look interesting, though. A burger topped with a fried green tomato, cajun goat cheese, and house made poblanos slaw.Huntsville has developed a pretty cool craft beer scene and Below The Radar is a fine addition to this beer scene."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,1,"No idea where the great reviews come from.  Tried twice and both times the food was a complete let down.  Beers on tap are normal for the area, nothing special."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,4,"I was here the other day for lunch. They provide free 2-hour parking across the street in the gravel lot. The service was very quick. They offer a variety of beers, cocktails, and wine. Their foods are mainly bar types of foods. I tried their jalapeño popper appetizer, and it was absolutely delicious! The ranch dip really complemented all the flavors packed in the little spicy, cheesy ball. I'm for the entree, I opted with the classic burger with Swiss cheese and sweet potato fries. It was good, as any standard burger would be. Their sweet potato fries come as a thicker cut, which I enjoyed, and was especially delicious with the honey mustard dip they provided. Everything there is pretty standard, along with its prices. If you're looking for a casual place to eat bar food and drink beer, it's a good place to check out."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,5,"I was in town again and wanted to swing by for the first time in a couple years. My co-workers and I always make sure we support local businesses while on the road, and we'll definitely be back on our next trip. Our bartender (Joseph M) was great and very knowledgeable about the beer and food. I had the pork chop it was amazing! Very juicy with a great sauce. Definitely check it out if you like good food and local beer!"
Below the Radar Brewery Co,5,Food was great and so was the service. I had a burger and fries.  Also tried the Mac and cheese bites.  I would recommend.
Below the Radar Brewery Co,3,"Really bad service. Every time I go, I end up here for about 2 hours just because it takes about an hour for the food to come out. Brunch is even slower than regular service. I would not recommend for big groups because you will wait forever to get your food. Also, they have a huge list of beer and drinks but they are always out of everything. It usually takes me three times asking for a drink before one I pick is actually in stock. That being said, the reuben is really good. And the music trivia on Friday night is really fun."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,3,"This place was okay. Nothing impressive at all if you want blunt honesty. The beer was the largest disappointment. I ordered the number one which tasted like Hi-C fruit punch and my friend ordered number three which came to her frozen and she was told it was the bottom of the tap and she could drink it if she wanted to. The food was mediocre at best. I got the Cobb salad... which was basic at best. I did steal some of my friends fries which weren't bad at all. She got the BLT, it came with an egg on top and she said it wasn't bad but wasn't impressive. The locations isn't terrible, they are located around the corner of SIP which is a whiskey bar, and they are down the street from MELT which is a much better choice then here. Like I said, it's not terrible but this place isn't impressive and under whelming at best."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,5,Went back for entrees. My husband had Stir Fried Tofu that was outstanding!  It didn't need any condiments at all and was so good he complimented the chef and was happy to brag to fellow customers who asked about it. It the best tofu dish he's ever had. I had a portobello mushroom burger and chose goat cheese as my cheese. It was good (but not spectacular); excellent house-made chips served on the side. Service and atmosphere were excellent as well. Can't go wrong here.
Below the Radar Brewery Co,5,This is a great place for brunch on the weekend. I went with my friends Kate and Joseph as a fifth person in their group. Not only did I enjoy meeting their family but also discovered this neat brewery. We had a quiet table to ourselves. There were great food options. My friend and I had eggs Benedict and scrambled with sides of potatoes and muffins. The fruit was fresh. Eggs flavorful and not greasy. Loved the feta in my eggs with spinach and onions. I did steal a few fries off my friends plate and they were delicious with their spicy ketchup!! I did not feel bloated at all! We all had different beers. I shared a sour beer which was great!it was a wonderful experience! Our server Zack was very good! Will go there again and again!
Below the Radar Brewery Co,2,"Beer is good. Food is really good. Only reason I gave this 2 stars is that when my husband & I came in at 5:15 we were told there weren't any tables available. He said seats at the bar were available but no tables. We would have rather sat at a table but wanted to try this brewery. We sat at bar. Bartender, food, and beer  were great. We sat there for an hour, looked around and there were empty tables everywhere. Seriously? We think they didn't want to take up a long table just for 2 of us. They should separate some of these tables for couples or foursomes. Come on......cater to your customer. They pay your bills and write your reviews."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,4,"Cool spot to grab beers, didn't get to eat there but was there during happy hour and the wings looked good not a huge selection of IPAs if you're a fan. They make a decent Bloody Mary with in house made mix."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,3,"Found this place on Yelp not far from my hotel when in town for business.I decided to go with the Burger of the Month - Mac Daddy Burger (Macaroni & Cheese, Bacon) with House Made Chips. Burger was cooked to Medium perfectly. Chips were a little disappointing, not all cooked evenly, some stuck together. I would also suggest some sort of dip for the chips.Even though not extremely busy on a weeknight, tables were so close I felt I was practically sitting with the party of 6 at the next table.I would definitely consider coming back on my next trip and recommend if you haven't been yet."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,3,"This is a nice gastric pub located in downtown Alabama. It was crowded on the weekend despite downtown being empty at this time. There is plenty of parking nearby or within a block. They had a long wait to be seated and despite putting the food order in after sitting down there was another lengthy wait. I guess they were backed up in the kitchen. They have a mimosa special for brunch. The place was busy and semi clean. The staff were working hard with the high demand. The food was good, but I was super hungry. The service was okay nothing extraordinary special."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,1,"Huntsville is not known for having great food options, and this is a prime example. Even for bar food, I would not recommend it. They do have a good beer selection, but do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else before or after that brew! I ordered the gnocchi only to find out they're gnocchi ""shells"" - so basically pasta in a bland pesto sauce. I chose to add shrimp that came out looking and tasting like microwaved cocktail shrimp. For $19 in Huntsville, I expect much better! Everyone in our party complained of the sub-par food quality and left most of our meals on the table. Even Cheddar's blows this place out of the water."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,3,Hard pour for mimosasMimosa price on the rise!!! BewareFrench toasts needs butterFriend potatoes fire (good)Sausage link was to die forPoor man cinnamon roll
Below the Radar Brewery Co,2,"Average. Service a bit slow for a bar type atmosphere.  I ordered pig skins. Thought it was potato but I can't read and it was pork rinds, not potato. It's a unique twist but I'm not a huge fan of pork rinds.  Should've gotten the wings.  Got the Reuben. It was average. The meat was a bit tough.  Sauerkraut and dressing was good.  The fries were good. Star of the night!  Lemonade was Minute Maid. Meh.  Seemed to have lots of beer options though!"
Below the Radar Brewery Co,4,"Been coming here for a long time and have finally come to a conclusion that there are some things at BTR that I cannot do without and some things there that I just flat-out don't like.First off, the atmosphere at BTR is great.  Very active on the inside with a nice view outward to the street.  At night time, however, it can get very loud due to the acoustics in the building and if they have live music, forget about having any conversation with you company.As for the food, it's always been hit or miss for me.  First the hits:  definitely the Grilled Rainbow Trout, any of their Burgers, Cuban Panini, Onion Rings, Raspberry White Chocolate Bread Pudding, and Shrimp and Grits.  For the misses: the Wings (odd flavors, and there never is enough sauce on the wings), Steak Wrap (for over $13 I actually expected to taste some steak), and Bangers and Mash (just...meh).Another thing that is odd is I've never known them to have a happy hour; or at least if they do have one, it's never been very noticable.But overall, a great place to hang out with friends, dine late (or early), and get good service.  Bartenders and wait staff have always been great."
Below the Radar Brewery Co,2,"Beer: Awesome!. Appetizers: Very Good!. Food: Terrible!. Staff: Need Training.Ordered a drink from the menu to find out they no longer make the drink from the menu but the bar tender can make it...way to strong to drink Ordered a sandwich from the menu to find out they don't have the sandwich from the menu.How about updating the menu? Or informing the guests about the days menu limitations... instead of me reviewing the menu for 10 mins to not get what I want after reviewing the menu for 10 mins!!Ordered something they did have, Diablo chicken nachos, and the chips were stale and the cheese was weird. So not the place for food, but drinks and apps, why not!!Check please"
Rhythm On Monroe,5,First time trying this restaurant and we will definitely be back. We grabbed drinks and apps on the rooftop bar then moved downstairs for dinner. We would recommend their mules and nachos. We are so glad to have a rooftop bar with great food in Huntsville.
Rhythm On Monroe,3,"Grew up in Huntsville, but now living in SoCal. Huntsville has really grown since I've left and I understand it is trying to have rooftop bars comparable to other city areas. Service was great, environment is alright, the view is okay... the drinks however were watered down... If you want a good craft cocktail go elsewhere. If you're looking for a new spot in the area to meet with your friends then check this place out."
Rhythm On Monroe,2,"This place is ok. The drinks were great. Pecan Crusted Trout was amazing. Wings were good. Steak.... Steak wasn't. First steak was over cooked and they also left the meat paper on the steak while grilling it. Second steak, still badly over cooked. Asked for medium, got medium well - well done. Service was excellent. Our server was attentive. The kitchen is out on the main floor... I think that they forget that. Hearing them yell ""fuck and whatever"" slam items around and throw a fit like a child, after being told about the steak. The manager did take the steak off after seeing the meat paper grilled to the first steak, without hesitation. However, the kitchen staff acting like children is why I won't be back. They need to understand everyone in the restaurant can hear them. Also, either choose to wear the masks or take them off. If they required to wear them, wear them right. Some had them, some had them hanging by one ear and some took theirs off. Uniformity looks amazing in a place like this."
Get Loaded,5,"We went to the food truck and my over all experience was amazing! The Loaded fries are amazing, Prices are not bad for what you get, andThe staff was super super friendly! They gave us a free dessert because of our wait which wasn't even that long! I felt bad taking it, but they insisted! The food tasted amazing! (I think I mentioned that before lol!) I will definitely be eating here again! Also they were taking Per cautions due to Covid-19 wearing mask and gloves!"
Get Loaded,5,Our apartment complex had this truck come for a couple of hours and I stopped by to try it! I got the loaded bacon fries with no jalapeños. It was a huge portion and so good! The also threw in an elephant ear free to try! (One of their desserts) it was all very good!
Get Loaded,4,"Get Loaded is a fairly new (I think) food truck that's come on my radar with the advent of food trucks visiting neighborhoods to serve folks in the midst of COVID-19.  I got word they were gonna be parked at a place not too far from where I live, so I made the drive over to check it out.Get Loaded offers loaded...everything!  Pretty much any medium that's ripe for toppings, they do it.  Loaded fries, loaded potatoes, loaded nachos, and loaded fry breads are their main offerings.  Loading combos vary but are available across all bases; I recall BBQ, buffalo chicken, queso, bacon, etc.  All of it sounded good.They were fairly busy but doing a great job politely encouraging customers to practice social distancing.  I was impressed at how carefully the gentleman who took my order handled the payments; he would simply offer the device through which you'd swipe your card out of the window.  He never touched the card at all!  All the staff was wearing gloves, too.  I tried the queso fries:  waffle fries loaded up with queso, ranch, bacon, and jalapeños.  Overall, I liked them a good deal.  The queso was white queso (my favorite - no fake nacho cheese for me, please!) and the jalapeños gave it a pretty strong kick.  I could've done with the bacon being a liiiittle bit crispier and in slightly larger chunks.  The majority of my fries were cooked to a perfect crispness, but a couple of the bigger ones had a slightly rubbery quality.  One warning:  this is food to be eaten as soon as it's delivered to your hands.  I'm glad I sat in the car and ate mine, because it would've gotten soggy on the way home.  Still, it was really tasty fresh.I got my boyfriend some buffalo chicken nachos that I brought back to the house.  These held up surprisingly well, better even than my fries held up in the 10-15 minutes it took me to eat them.  The buffalo chicken was chunked up in bite size pieces and was juicy and flavorful.Overall, I'd definitely visit this food truck again.  I hope they continue to see success - I'd love to try out some fry bread one day.  Never had that before.  :)  Remember, since this is a food truck, check their social media to see where they are before you head to the address listed on Yelp!"
The Po’Boy Factory,5,Wife and I haven't been here in a long time.  We enjoyed the food then and again we weren't disappointed.  We tried their Sloppy Joe fries with their fried pickles. The fries were awesome.  The fried pickles were just as good.
The Po’Boy Factory,4,"We moved to the South about 2 years ago, and I had never had a Po'Boy before moving here.  When I saw this place, while looking through my Yelp, I talked my husband into going.  We have since returned several times.  Each Po'Boy I get has been great.  Packed full of fillings.  The fried pickles, hushpuppies, and the Jambalaya are good as well.  As I said, I have never had Po'Boys before this, so nothing to compare it to except if it's something I would eat again.  Which I will.I will say that service is nice, but a little slow, even on days the place didn't have many tables filled.  That would be my only down side.  Other than that this is definitely a place we will go to again."
The Po’Boy Factory,4,"We had the crayfish carry-out which was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of spices, not too hot but with the right amount of kick to make them delicious.  Can't wait till we can sit down and have a meal inside."
The Po’Boy Factory,3,This place had really good reviews so we tried it out . It took awhile to get our waitress to take our order. Then it took awhile to get our order . The food was pretty good my biggest complaint was they barely put the olive mixture for the muffuletta. Other than that the roast beef had a great flavor which was on the fries . We honestly probably won't go back if we return to the area .
The Po’Boy Factory,5,"This place is amazing! We came in Saturday for lunch and  it was packed. We were sent to Scruffys next door . It's the same owner and the same menu.My date got the Shrimp Po Boy, he loved it. It was fresh, & stuffed to the gils with large shrimp. Also tried the shrimp n crab dip. Oh it was amazing! The perfect blend of cheese and seafood . Overall it's a small independent establishment . We will definitely  be back!"
The Po’Boy Factory,5,In town from Ky for a work trip. Just picked this place out off the name and the menu and I mad a great choice. Everything I had was good. Service excellent and the decor quaint but festive. Try the house made Hot Damn sauce. I could eat it on tree bark. Wish I could take this place back home to Kentucky.
The Po’Boy Factory,4,"A casual, unassuming place that kicks our some good cajun food. With a name like the Po Boy Factory, I knew I had to get a po boy and to accompany it, fries and gumbo. The server brought out samples of the red beans and rice, jambalaya, and etoufee, and I must say, the etoufee was my favorite.I had the crawfish po boy and I will say it was a bit light from what I am used to, but the price was also very good. Knowing what a po boy should look like, I would have gladly paid a few dollars more for a fuller po boy, but I do understand that this restaurant has to compete in the Huntsville market.The service was very good and the customers were enjoying their meals and the company. Huntsville is lucky to have this place. Is it the most authentic? Absolutely not. Is it good? Absolutely."
The Po’Boy Factory,4,"Tried PBF for the first time. I must say, I was very impressed. I got the scruffy combo. I chose the sloppy roast beef sandwich, red beans and rice and fries. My wife got the shrimp po'boy, jambalaya and fries. We had an order of fried pickles too. So my sandwich was AMAZING. I loved it! That French loaf is great stuff. The red beans and rice and jambalaya were great too. The flavors are just perfect. I tried her po'boy and really liked it. The tartar sauce is one of the best I've tasted. I recommend giving PBF a try if you've never gone.  The place is nothing fancy, but it is very unique! I'm definitely going back and trying something new!"
The Po’Boy Factory,3,"As part of our staycation, this was the food stop. It's certainly a local joint with plenty of Mardi Gras masks, posters, decals, etc. I got the shrimp Po'Boy and my husband got the Caribbean jerk po'boy. Both were ok (shrimp didn't have much flavor, and neither did the fries). My husband loved the fried pickles. In one part of the restaurant's decor is are the painted ceiling tiles of local, collegiate and professional sports teams (done by an Atlanta artist). The Gamecock one was particularly impressive."
The Po’Boy Factory,1,"This is hands down the worst place I've ever eaten at because of Yelp! Came here because of the rave reviews and wasted $20 on a shrimp poboy, fries and red beans and rice. The shrimp were fried to hide the fact that they don't even take the time to clean them! I thought I had just found a 'missed one' by chance so I inspected the rest...nope! None of them had been deveined - disgusting! I stopped eating right then and the rest went in the garbage. Crinkle cut fries were standard frozen fries, no big deal there. The rice and beans were ok but nothing to write home about. I couldn't find anything that tasted creole or similar to authentic New Orleans fare. The remoulade sauce was probably the closest. Definitely not a fan...and definitely will not be back. You let me down yelpers! :("
The Po’Boy Factory,5,"I cannot say enough about the service this place had! The food was very good too, but I feel like it was probably a bit better if we were there when the normal hours are. Food was ok, but the people I was with raves over there's still to this day. (I'm posting a week later). I can't wait to try it when I have more time to actually sit down and enjoy  my food rather than rushing so much."
The Po’Boy Factory,2,"I decided to order a basket of half pickles half fries ,a cup of gumbo and red beans and rice and the restaurant gave me complimentary bread and crackers with my order .It was good ,the gumbo was a little seafoody and honestly I wish I could've maybe gotten a little more seasoning in the gumbo .I didn't really care for the red beans and rice it seemed like that lacked flavor as well and the pickles seemed to be the most flavorful part of my meal .I think this place is okay .But in the west coast I have had better .."
The Po’Boy Factory,5,"This restaurant was on my list to try for a while, so when my friend came into town for a visit, we decided to check it out. We were NOT disappointed. We were seated almost immediately, as the restaurant was not super crowded at the time. Our orders were taken with 10 minutes  - we decided to split the shrimp and crab dip, and we both went with po' boys - I had the half shrimp, half oyster and my friend did half shrimp, half catfish. No meal of mine can truly be complete without dessert, so we split the house bread pudding, which came with a whiskey sauce on the side. I skipped out on the sauce, by my friend who did have it enjoyed the caramel flavor, and noted a very strong whiskey presence at the end - which you may or may not have an issue with. I'm really glad I got to check this spot out, and shout out to Stephanie for excellent, excellent service!!!"
The Po’Boy Factory,3,I started with the gumbo and it was excellent and it was loaded with seafood.  I ordered an Oyster plate and was disappointed.  I only got 5 very small oysters.  However my friend ordered the jambalaya along with the fried catfish and said it was wonderful.  I plan on going back and ordering something different.
The Po’Boy Factory,5,I have been coming here for over 10 years! LOVE THIS PLACE! Service may be slow at times but they are always super nice and it is always worth it.
The Po’Boy Factory,3,"Great service for sure. However, I was quite underwhelmed by the food. I tried the grouper basket with fries and hushpuppies. The fries were just not good. Grouper was just ok as were the hushpuppies. Nothing special or reminiscent of NOLA. Although it's hard to replicate NOLA style cuisine anywhere else, I am not sure I would return if I visit Huntsville again."
The Po’Boy Factory,5,The mahi poyboy was amazing. I also had a cup of gumbo and tried the fried pickles. Yes I know I'm fat. It was very good. They have this tarter sauce that is like crack. Equivalent to the times I've been to Nola. Nice people. Good vibes. Be back tommorow
The Po’Boy Factory,5,"We love the Po Boy factory! Anytime we have family in town they want to go here for a meal. Seafood is alwaYs good, service is great, prices are the best and they have one of the best hamburgers around!"
The Po’Boy Factory,4,The place has been around a long time in huntsville. It's a consistent place to get the infamous Po Boy sandwich. My favorite is the oyster. I really recommend and like their shrimp etouffe and their catfish. The mahi I had was very thin and I wasn't impressed with the portion. I'll go back to the catfish or po boy. Always crowded but great service.
The Po’Boy Factory,5,"Oh man. This place has the best po boys in the entire world. The servers are the sweetest, almost as sweet as the sweet tea! Don't expect much in terms of fancy dining experience, but for the cheap prices and fast service it's the absolute best."
La Esquina Cocina,5,"One word that describes La Esquina Cocina - Fresh!A fresh idea to Huntsville and fresh food make this a must-have in the area.As soon as we walked in, we were greeted warmly and seated. The interior is rustic modern, and very clean. The bathrooms are well lit and also spotless. They offer small square tables with four seats, which can be moved together for a party. The windows made it feel more opened and welcomed the sunshine.Our waitress approached and started to explain tapas - we have visited many tapas bars; however, it may be a new concept to many Huntsvillians, and it could bring confusion for some people. Tapas is essentially a small meal -think appetizer- and is traditionally found in Spain. It was a covered dish served with your drink at the bar, and since it has become a global cuisine that is practiced around the world with various dishes.My family (including two kids) stopped into this great tapa's restaurant in search of new and exciting foods. I was excited, as I had been a while since I have visited a tapas bar. Since everything is small, we ordered a variety of dishes to try and share. The hardest part was deciding what to order!Let start with the drinks-Margarita- this is the best margarita I have had in the States. It has freshly squeezed juice with just the right spice, and the rim is coated with demerara and tamarind-chili pepper rim. I will come back just for these!Platano Old Fashion- A new and interesting spin on the Old Fashion. The banana infused bourbon is complemented well with the cacao nib bitters.  It peeked our intersted, and surprising intrigued us. It is not what you would expect. It is a bit sweet, with a mild taste of fresh banana. If you like mild Old Fashions, this is a perfect drink to try!Oaxacan Old Fashion- has Mezcal aged tequila and mole bitters. This drink is a favorite and has more robust, yet smooth flavors that any Old Fashion lover will enjoy.Everyone made a few food selections, and we ordered:Rice - fresh, flavorful, and satisfyingFrijoles refitos- fresh and homemade refried beansTortas de papa - traditional flavor you can only find in grandmas kitchenGorditas-pleasantly filled and large, not over fried or dressedBaja style caught fish- amazing and fresh - we have been searching for this for over a year! This, hands down, is worth trying! The fish was fresh, crispy, and a perfect balance to the taco.Carne asada- A taco with grilled steak that takes perfectCompechano- A taco with steak and chorizo - you will not find the heart burning, greasy chorizo here! A perfect compliment to each other.Chorizo Taco- Another great taco that is well balanced without greasePork tamale- handmade with love, grandma, must be in the kitchenArtichoke chorizo dip- Voted as one of Alabama's favorite new dishes.All the tacos are on handmade, in house, corn torillas, and the vegetables are fresh and crisp. The dressings, salsa, and other dips had a well-balanced flavor that excited the senses. The kids loved it as much as adults. While, you are doing not going to find, necessarily a 'kids menu,' they do offer kid-friendly foods, if your child is picky. Opt for the rice, beans, and a taco.If you think I am a little over-excited - perhaps I am! This place sparked joy and excitement for my family. Nearly all the food is gluten-free - and they even have gluten-free desserts!! We didn't have any, as we were all stuffed! However, we will be back, as this has become our new favorite place.They also offer a wide variety of vegetarian dishes! They also collaborate with local farms and purveyors to provides an excellent choice that supports our community. Erika Rios is a true inspiration to the food scene here in HSV!"
La Esquina Cocina,4,"La Esquina is pretty good! I saw it while I was home driving downtown, so I figured I'd try it. My mom, husband and I usually eat Mexican food on Friday nights whenever my husband and I are in town. We normally go to Phil's but didn't feel like driving. Downtown is right around the corner from where my mom lives so this location was convenient. The Friday afternoon we went was perfect. The weather was great and it was a good day to eat Mexican. The inside is very spacious. The seating was 6 ft apart if not more. We felt comfortable eating out right after COVID. Our waiter was very nice and accommodating. I also love tapas style restaurants so this was a plus. I love being able to try multiple dishes at once. My mom, husband and I all ordered a bunch of tapas and shared. We didn't share the single items like tacos but everything else was shareable. My husband and I started off by ordering margaritas. I had a Watermelon Margarita and he had the Top Shelf, both were good! I was pleased with the balance of sweetness to alcohol my drink had. It wasn't overly sweet but the alcohol was balanced and not overpowering. Now onto the food....TOTOPOS W/ 2 SALSAS - YUMMM! Corn chips with roasted tomato serrano salsa and tomatillo salsa. These were probably the best chips we've had in a long time. They were seasoned with the perfect amount of salt and fried perfectly! The crunch with the salsas was so good! The salsas were also flavorful and tasted homemade. ARTICHOKE CHORIZO DIP - GOOD! Homemade chorizo, artichokes, cream salsa. Side of totopos. This dip was very good and flavorful. I really enjoyed this dip. ENCHILADAS DE CANASTA - DECENT! Potato hash, guajillo salsa, cabbage, sour cream and queso fresco. This was decent. It wasn't bad but it also wasn't anything special. POLLO AL PASTOR TACO - GOOD! Grilled chicken marinated in roasted pineapple and achiote. Chipotle salsa, cilantro and onions. This taco was small and only comes with one. It was very flavorful and I love the play on a traditional Al Pastor taco (pork and pineapple). The chicken was tender and yummy! The pineapple adds that sweet kick! CHORIZO TACO - GOOD! Homemade pork sausage, cilantro, onions, roasted tomato salsa. This taco also only comes with one. It was pretty good! I enjoyed the flavor. It wasn't the best chorizo taco I've had but it was decent. FISH EMPANADAS - DECENT!  Lightly fried turnover, white fish, sweet peppers, pico de gallo. This was ok to me. I didn't feel it was anything special. Not bad but nothing to talk about. FRIJOLES FRITOS - YUM! Peruvian refried beans, queso fresco crumble. Side of totopos. This dip is simple yet flavorful. I enjoyed this dip a lot! Overall, La Esquina was pretty good. I would come back whenever I'm in downtown Huntsville and want Mexican."
La Esquina Cocina,2,"I really wanted to love this place, but my first experience just was not good.We dined on a weekday night, and the place was packed, which is a good thing. The hostess was very friendly, and seated us promptly. A good start. Our server was also very friendly, and trying very hard to ensure we had a good experience, which started out as a good thing but quickly got overbearing. It got to the point where we needed to tell her we would let her know if we needed anything further because she seemly kept hovering around our table. The disappointing part of our experience was the food and cost.  The server came to our table and immediately asked if we would like to start with totopos (tortilla chips) and salsa, and we said ""sure""! The totopos were oily, and the salsas served were fine.The issue here is that they cost $7. I will gladly pay for quac or a good queso dip, but $7 for the chips and salsa here was grossly overpriced. Even if the taste was excellent, it is just not an item I would pay $7 for, at any time. We also order the rojas con queso, which was disappointing. The reason for the disappointment in this dish was because the dip was lukewarm. Maybe others dont share this same thought, but I prefer queso to be extremely hot when it is served. The overall taste was fine, but it was not served hot. We also tried the chicken soup, which was average at best, without much flavor. I could have used some hot sauce to punch up the flavor of the dish. Those two dishes aside, the fish empanda was tasty, as was the enchiladas de canasta. I also ordered the Pambazo, which never was served to me. The server never noticed this, so when I got the bill, the dish was still on it. I had to ask for it to be removed. Lastly, we did order some cocktails, and I felt they were well intended but lacked flavor/booze. And for the price of $13, completely overpriced. The cocktail prices are not on the menu, so be aware.Overall - for the cost, portion size, and quality, it misses the mark. I left hungry after paying over $100 for 3 total drinks and a handful of the tapas. I hope they improve, and I will go back and give it another chance, but at the moment, it is not a place I would recommend going, both for the food quality and the overall value. Once the kinks are worked out, I will gladly revise my review if the quality increases."
La Esquina Cocina,5,"A mashup of Mexican, Tex/Mex in an open and airy casual industrial eatery. La Esquina Cocina means ""the corner kitchen"" and true to its name offers everything from scratch chicken soup to aged NY Strip Steak.  A creative menu with plenty of options with veg based plates, several chicken plates, a few fish and of course several pork and beef choices. One of their sharable selections with a couple single plates make for a great meal.A couple notes - we're not drinkers but the bar set up looked outstanding - and they support several local farms providing cheese, vegs and meats."
La Esquina Cocina,3,"I just had lunch there and my feelings are mixed.The menu is a tapas menu.  No entrees. The tapas items are priced close to entree prices, though they are, of course, small.So, for $20, no beverage, after tax, before tip, I had two rather small fish empanadas and a small serving of Peruvian refried beans, which were served just above lukewarm.The reason my feelings are mixed is that the empanadas were EXCELLENT, top notch, no reservations.I would really like to see this place offer lunch combinations or otherwise special lunch prices to provide a full meal for under $12 that would be able to satisfy this 220 lb man. ;)"
La Esquina Cocina,5,"Very nice place, server was great. Flavors were really really good. Started with their queso home made chips- very good. The empanada was very good but should have been drained a little more. We ordered different tacos and they were all great. I'll be back for sure and bribing others."
La Esquina Cocina,5,"This place was great.  The atmosphere was inviting and, though we were eating rather early (11:30am on a Sunday) it wasn't crowded at all, though there was a bit of a lively crowd.Our server was attentive and I wish I'd caught her name--she was excellent at keeping our sodas refilled, recommended items without being pushy, and was extremely kind.  Google reviews are a bit unkind on portions, but this is a tapas joint, not an all you can eat buffet and the ingredients are fresh, authentic, and well prepared.  (Having lived in SoCal, I feel it fair to judge these things.)I may skip an item or two, but we had the:Totopos with 2 salsas.  Freshly made tortilla chips, a bit thicker than most places but NOT in a bad way.  The green tomatillo salsa was superior to the red which could have used more cilantro in my book, but both were good.Pork gordita.  This was heavenly and would have been a filling lunch solo if you weren't starving.  Chile en nogada.  This is a star of a dish.  The pine nuts and almonds were spiced well with something sweet--I thought raisins were in the dish, but I'm not sure.  Pambazo.  Think a really good sandwich with homemade chorizo dipped in a chile-based sauce that is dripping with flavor (and also a bit dripping with said sauce).  Loved this.Pork tamal - This was a star and I'm glad our server recommended it.  The masa wasn't over-steamed (this can be an issue) and the sauce was heavenly.Overall, everything was fairly priced for the end product.  Yum."
La Esquina Cocina,5,"We have only eaten here once, but will most definitely be back!!  The street tacos were amazing!! Can't wait to go back and try the nachos!!! If you haven't given these folks a try yet, you are missing out!!"
La Esquina Cocina,5,"We came here after the HSV Mardi Gras parade. I order a jalapeno margarita. The margarita was really good and fresh, but not as spicy as I was hoping for. I appreciated that they got my son a lemonaid without charging me after I had already paid for my drink. Their drinks are very fresh and delicious. I can not wait to go back to try the food, probably will leave the kids at home. Everyone was very friendly and I appreciated that more then anything! Well.. I appreciate the clean bathrooms almost as equal. *Esquina means corner, very clever"
La Esquina Cocina,5,"This is my new favorite restaurant! Every bite of food I had was incredible! The atmosphere is nice and modern, and our server, Chandler, was so friendly and wonderful! My husband and I had the best experience! We recommend the tortas de papa, the empanadas de carina, the pozole, and tostada de atun. The Paloma was also amazing! I'm planning to recommend this place to all my friends and family!"
La Esquina Cocina,5,This restaurant is amazing!! The ambience is super trendy and beautiful. The best part is the food (as it should be) very fresh and flavorful! Usually I am not hard to  impressed in Huntsville and this restaurant really impressed me. The Chile en nogada was my favorite dish! I actually thought the portions were pretty large for tapas. Loved it!!!
La Esquina Cocina,3,"Has great potential! The atmosphere is great, but it is a little loud since the floors are concrete. I think after some time, since this is a new restaurant, things will flow better for them. There were a few mistakes that would have made the dinner more enjoyable, but I think that comes with experience. For example, the wine glasses were visibly dirty, and a few mistakes with drinks. The food was pretty good, but just a little heavy and salty. But I think it's a great addition to Huntsville!"
La Esquina Cocina,3,"I read other reviews and was really looking forward to trying this new downtown mexican option.  The building is very cool, but as with most downtown establishments, parking can be an issue.  I met a friend there at 6pm on a Monday, and was shocked to see so few people there at which is prime time in HSV during the week.  Figured it was due to it being Monday, or the dismal weather, or whatever.We had a couple cocktails from the bar which were quite good, from fresh (non-mix) ingredients, albeit a bit pricey.  We then ordered 3 small plates and a ""sharable"" to, well, share.  One of the tapas consisted of chicken meatballs in a thick salsa sauce and it was pretty bad.  Not sure what they were going for but had trouble finishing it, and not because we were full.  The fish empanadas were much better, as was the stuffed poblano pepper, which was the best item we sampled IMHO.  We shared the enchiladas which was good and had some interesting flavors, but had a thick cornmeal wrapper you normally expect with tamales.The real downer was the price.  For a dinner with modest portions and a couple drinks, the bill for each of us was $57.  We left full but not stuffed, and feeling like we should have been VERY impressed with the quality of food for these prices.  Giving 3 stars and encouragement to up their portions and quality, or lower their prices to match the caliber of the food.  I'd generously award 4 stars for the food and drink (except the chicken dish), and 1 star for value.  This may explain the meager turnout on a weeknight, when most new places in Huntsville are packed for months as everyone checks out the new kid in town."
La Esquina Cocina,4,Food was yummy. Lots of flavor and good portion sizes. Service was okay and did not enjoy the margarita. Overall would definitely try this place out again.
La Esquina Cocina,5,"We went to this fantastic new Mexican restaurant tonight. It is a ""small plates"" tapas menu which encouraged us to try several things. Everything we tried was outstanding and the ingredients were fresh. Everything is made on site. I have never had a dip quite like their artichoke dip. It is fantastic! The charcuterie plate, the entrees, and the deserts were all mouth watering as well. This place is a welcome addition to the Huntsville restaurant scene and is quite different from the other Mexican spots in town. Highly recommended!"
La Esquina Cocina,5,"We had an amazing first experience at La Esquina Cocina. As a group of 6 of us we tried 18 different tapas (they recommend 2-3 per person) and there was not a single thing we tried that we didn't enjoy. The size of the plates were perfect for a tapas/small plates restaurant, and I loved the ability to try so many different things. The price ended up less than I thought for a tapas restaurant of this quality, we will definitely be back! I can't pick a favorite but a few I recommend are the Empanadas de Carne, Chile en nogada, and the Enchiladas Verde"
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"This was my second time here, after a lack luster first visit years ago, our first post Covid meal, we decided to give it another chance. The establishment has more then redeemed itself. Jenn (that's right two Ns) was very nice and took great care of us. The prime steak was literally heaven! Kudos to everyone who had something to do with that piece of meat. I write this on the cusp of my meat coma...do yourself a favor and get it medium rare, you'll thank me later."
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"Love this place. It's a boujee seafood and steakhouse at Bridge Street. It's not ""suit jacket required"" fancy, but I do get some glares from wait staff when I come in wearing a band t-shirt and ripped jeans.The lunch menu is nothing short of amazing. My favorite thing to get is the 7oz Grilled Sirloin Filet. It comes with a loaded baked potato for $14!!! That's right, just FOURTEEN DOLLARS! Connors does not sacrifice quality here and serve a cheap cut of steak. It's the exact same thing you get at dinner for $10 less. The steak is cooked beautifully with grill marks to get you know it's legit. The steaks are always cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. My other favorite things to get are the sweet potato fries and spinach. For an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the Voodoo Shrimp. It's sweet and spicy and tangy and delicious. I'm not really a fan of their bartender. I've only had one or two mixed drinks that were actually palatable. It's safer to stick with beer (personally like Angry Orchard Apple Cider) or a glass of wine. There's usually a long wait (30min+), but they do offer ""call ahead seating"" as well as traditional seating reservations, but beware, you have to get there within 5 minutes of your reservation time or they will give your table away! The reservation system is really cool here. The hostess takes your name and phone number and they send you a text message when your table is ready. Allowing you to continue to shop around in the Bridge Street stores."
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"The Espresso Martinis are delicious here. I have also had a bloody mary, those are good too, but unfortunately not spicy. The last time I was here I had crab legs and they were excellent with the melted butter. The steak is always amazing and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend the chicken Parmesan! It is soo good! Also there Mac and cheese is amazing and not too creamy. The fried shrimp appetizer is not called bang bang shrimp, but it is like it and it is also amazing and highly recommended!I would book your reservation a week or two in advance, so you are one of the hangry people waiting for 2 hours in the crowded door area."
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"I have enjoyed this restaurant FIVE times. Each time I would give it a FIVE STAR Rating! They take pride in serving the very best tasting food each and every time. I have not had this experience elsewhere. This will be the place I bring company from out of town, and come to when I would date night. 1.) Appetizers are so good you can make a meal out of them.2.) Steaks are seasoned and cooked to juicy perfection.3.) Deserts are a large portion, and always good.4.) Sides are always uniformly good.5.) Their level of service is consistently good. The Chick Fil A of fine dining.My favorite restaurant in Huntsville by far!"
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"Every time we go to Connors we never leave unhappy or less than extremely full. Connors has the best lunch and dinner in town. Hands down to me. You have to get the Signature Lobster Crab Bisque. It is the best bisque in the area. It is so rich and velvety and smooth with lobster and crab. A delicious beginning to your meal. Breakdown for lunch and dinner.Lunch: Soup and Two sides (bisque with the truffled deviled eggs and collard green)Boursin Burger (they make their own Boursin Cheese and it's amazing on EVERYTHING)Sirloin Steak (add that Boursin cheese)Dinner:Boursin Filet (Med rare with Boursin cheese and Tabasco onions, yum)Shrimp linguini (again this has Boursin cheese)Sirloin (add the Boursin)Dessert for every meal: Key Lime Pie. Get the key lime pie and be amazed. Pretty much, get the bisque, get something with the Boursin cheese, and get the key lime pie. Get the truffled deviled eggs, cheese grits, collard greens, or Mac and cheese. You will not be disappointed with Connors. The ambience is very nice and can be very romantic. We love to go here for special occasions and for date nights."
Connors Steak & Seafood,4,"I was in Huntsville on a Saturday afternoon and decided to give Connors Steak and Seafood a try. They have a great lunch menu and lunch is served until 4:30. The restaurant was crowded and there was a 45 minute wait for a table. I opted to sit at the bar. The bar area was crowded as well but the servers were attentive and on top on their game. I started off with a cocktail and was offered complimentary warm bread. After looking over the menu choices, I ordered the chicken piccata with mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. Yes, way too many carbs!! The chicken and potatoes were pretty good. I didn't care much for the macaroni and cheese. Next time, I will try something different. Overall, I enjoyed my experience."
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"Katie the floor manager is awesome. Abby the server was attentive. I ordered the blue point oysters. They were perfectly fresh! For dinner I got 10oz sirloin, they marinate it over night first. It was incredibly tender and was the perfect medium rare! I would also recommend getting the cream spinach and baked potato.They pair very well together! Crème brûlée was fantastic! Not a cheap place to eat, so bring your wallet!"
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"We arrived at Conner's in time to have a half-price happy hour drink in the bar that we carried to our table. We ordered Caesar salad, lobster and crab bisque, and a 9 oz. Boursin filet with a loaded bake potato. My favorite was the lobster bisque (I could have made a meal of it--so good). My hubby's favorite was predictably the filet cooked to medium rare. We felt dinner was a great value since the bisque and baked potato were included in the filet price, and we added a Caesar salad for only $4.00.The timing for our courses was a little off, which I explained to the manager when he came by and ask how everything was. He said that one of his line cooks didn't show up so the staff was having to double up to cover he's spot. I was glad to learn that was not the norm and is the reason I gave 5 stars along with the fact that our server, Page, was very pleasant and attentive.Dessert was a warm German chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream--so yummy. As you can see, the presentation was really nice."
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"Connors is awesome. If you want a guaranteed excellent meal and outstanding customer service, come here. I love sitting at the bar as these bartenders are da bomb. I had the Halibut today and it was sooooooooo good. Probably the best fish I have ever had in my entire life!!! The general manager does an outstanding job!!! Best restaurant in all of Huntsville hands down!"
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"Came here for dinner with coworkers. It was my first visit, so I opted for the steak. I got the ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes. I got the steak medium and it was juicy, tender and packed with flavor. I also got the garlic mashed potatoes at the server's recommendation. It too was delicious and packed with flavor. I got the connors old fashioned. It was good. I devoured my meal, which is very rare. The server handled our table remarkably as well."
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"You know you had a good dinner when you can barely walk back to your hotel! This place deserves a 5 star rating for legit sure!!! Lol. I literally felt like I was in Beverly Hills will all the fancy nancy food menu and ambience. Anyway, the lobster was superb, the king crabs were to die for, the side of cheese grits was beyond something I haven't ate in awhile (home-cooking at this), strawberry shortcake was wow wow wow! And finally, I saved the best for last; them devil eggs with bacon was beyond way beyond best appetizer I have ever eaten! Amen..."
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,This is our second visit.  The staff is eager to help you in any way they can.  Food is cooked to perfection.  Great menu choices.  Steaks are not overly seasoned so you can actually taste the meat. The Chilean sea bass is just right. We don't live in Huntsville but will come back every time we are in area. I highly recommend it.
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"This was a fantastic dinner. A group went out, and everyone was highly impressed. I've been here a few times before, and the quality is still top notch. The service is impeccable, and they have something for everyone on the menu. My filet was so tender and tasty, and the soup and sides were also of the highest quality. It's certainly not cheap, but you get every pennies worth. We were able to sit and talk, and no one rushed us. We left a nice tip to thank them for their hospitality. Highly recommended for a special evening or when you're trying to impress."
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,My wife and I have been to Conners quite a few times and every time the food and service have been consistently outstanding. I recomebd the fish and chips or the roasted duck both along with the ecceptional service will not disappoint.
Connors Steak & Seafood,3,"I got takeout and the food is usually good when I go there but the steak was overcooked and dry. Also, The bread was almost too hard to eat. Other than that, The mashed potatoes and broccoli were good."
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,This place in bangin good! The area is really nice and the atmosphere is business casual. The lunch menu is amazing. Not too expensive and the food is great. I got steak which was incredible. Maybe one of the best sirloins I've ever had. I highly recommend trying it out.
Connors Steak & Seafood,3,"Hmm.  Connor's can be pretty good but I'm not sure if it's worth the price.I've been twice now.  My most recent visit was good in some ways and not so good in others; hence the 3 stars.  We had a reservation for 7 at 7:30; we arrived promptly but were not seated until 7:47.  Some of our party didn't get their entrees until 9:20 - while they did send the dish back the first time to cook the steak further, that still seems like an excessively long wait time.  Overall, except for wait times, service was pretty good.  Our drinks were kept full and our orders were at least taken quickly, which is about all you can ask for.We had a ton of food.  For appetizers, we split the shrimp cocktail, the voodoo shrimp, and the fried mushrooms.  The shrimp cocktail was quite underwhelming.  Voodoo shrimp were a touch too hot for us but still enjoyable.  The fried mushrooms were probably the best dish.  Really enjoyed the breading and the mustard sauce.The wedge and strawberry salads before our meals were well received, although perhaps a little heavy on the bleu cheese on the wedges.  For entrees, we had sirloins, a ribeye, a filet mignon, a pork chop, chicken tenders, and a grilled chicken salad.  Grilled chicken salad was about as unremarkable as expected.  Palatable enough, nothing special.  Pork chop was very solid, liked the apple chutney.  My sirloin and my boyfriend's ribeye were cooked to our liking.  Chicken tenders were yummy and the serving size on this dish was very generous.   However, my boyfriend's mom and my friend's steak both arrived undercooked.  My friend was being ticky-tacky about his, but my boyfriend's mom ordered medium-well and received medium rare.  Not great, and it took far too long for them to get their meals back.As for sides:  garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus were both great.  Fries were over salted but okay.  Both of us who got macaroni and cheese were very disappointed in it; it was very overcooked and didn't have much flavor.  Overall, I would say that Connor's is a nice place for a special occasion.  However, I feel there are several areas in which they need to do better in order to warrant the price."
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"Have been meaning to go for a long time.  Heard great stories.  Finally went for our anniversary.  All the way from the Lemon Drop martini to the amazing slightly wood smoked, seasoned steaks was absolutely amazing.    Sirloin was as tender as a fillet.  The ribeye was full of flavor.  Excellent atmosphere and service."
Connors Steak & Seafood,5,"Best steak and grilled shrimp I've ever had. Connor's has never disappointed. A ridiculously long wait, if you don't make reservations, shows just how good this place is."
Connors Steak & Seafood,4,"Salmon Ceasar salad is all I have to say. My girlfriend and I probably eat these way more than we should when we come into town, but it's worth every useless piece of cellulose that we consume. Service is always great. Krystal is my absolute favorite!"
Toybox Bistro,5,This is my first time to Huntsville to enjoy the Space Center and found this little bistro to stop for lunch with my son.  We are big Star Wars fans and loved all the toys.  The food was awesome and the service was top notch.  A must stop while in Huntsville!
Toybox Bistro,5,"I was trying to go to a place that I'd heard about in this area but I ran late and that place was closed, so I needed something nearby, and my expectations for a good lunch were elevated since I was pretty sure the place I originally wanted to go was going to be amazing, but since that place closed, I decided to try The Toy Box Bistro instead. I do not regret it at all.To start I'll say that the place is a relatively small restaurant that's sort of crammed into a small strip near an intersection and you wouldn't know from the outside that the food would be so good. Inside, the whole place is decked out with 80s cartoon memorabilia. Ninja Turtles, Star Wars and all that sort of stuff. I have to say that I don't understand the obsession with this sort of stuff, but whatever...if the food is good then the food is good. It was.I decided on a pot roast sandwich and my friend has some other sandwich, I can't remember which one but it was absurd. I ordered waffled mac and cheese and fries as the sides. I'd never heard of waffled mac and cheese, it's basically mac and cheese thrown into a waffle iron and cooked until it reaches peak deliciousness. Interesting stuff for sure. The sandwiches had so much meat on them that we both just sort of looked at them for a minute to form a plan of attack. Both were delicious. Good service, what seems like a full bar, 80s cartoon stuff everywhere, and ridiculous portions of really good food for very low prices. I think it was around 30 bucks for 2 people to eat more than they should have and we didn't even finish everything. Couldn't ask for more, and I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in the area."
Toybox Bistro,2,"Don't understand the hype for this place other than it is decorated differently.  Burgers were average or less, nothing much else to say."
Toybox Bistro,2,"I just don't even know where to begin expressing how let down I was with this place. It's a rare day I get to take a little road trip out of Birmingham, and I've been fortunate to look on Yelp and gauge where I'll eat lunch each time I come to Huntsville. (I usually make it a point to go to Montgomery and Huntsville as much as possible to be around vets and feel at home again.)This place had so many rave ratings and I just knew it would be amazing, but Lord o' mercy, were those folks wrong. The restaurant, itself, is decorated really cute just like the photos suggest. It's tucked away in this small shopping area mainly loaded with college book stores.My waitress was pretty friendly and hospitable (at first), so that was nice. I got the Gobblin's Knob, which was basically just a lukewarm bread bowl with some dry, shredded meat mixed with week-old smelling eggs, and a slice of processed gouda on top. It was absolutely the driest meal I've ever eaten and tasted funky. The whole ride home, I was praying to not have to make pit stops for bad food...It was clear nothing was freshly-made because everything came out so quickly. I even heard the lady in front of my booth exclaim how quickly hers came out and the waitress said, ""Yup, in 10 minutes or less."" Hmmmm..In the meantime, I'd asked for the mac and cheese waffles. As I was tearing at my bread bowl, the manager (I guess?) came and threw a sharper knife down on the table next to me. I told him it was okay, that I was fine with eating with my hands, but he got really frustrated with the waitress and said, ""It's supposed to be served with that knife!"" Lemme tell ya now, sweetheart, it ain't a 5 star restaurant, so I wouldn't stress about the knife...Anyway, I only ate about 1/3 of the bowl, it was so dry. So the waitress asked me if I was done eating it. I told her it was just a lot of bread for me and she got really agitated and snatched the plate like I was inconveniencing them for not eating the hockey puck in front of me.The mimosa I got in the meantime was nothing more than some orange juice with a pear-flavored cider poured in. Don't waste your money. Although the music was reminiscent of my younger days, they had songs like ""I Wanna Sex You Up"" playing as a ""little princess"" came in with her family (cute touch). Instead of changing the station, they left it playing, much to the chagrin of any respectable parent, I'd hope.Finally, since I barely ate any of the main course, which was small to begin with, I tore into the mac and cheese waffles in the car. Disgusting. They were devoid of all flavor and dry as a bone just like the entree beforehand. All in all, I paid a whopping $25 for the mediocre meal. It's unfortunate, because the place had a lot of potential. Also, I'd suggest doing away with the ""portal"", because hearing someone yell that 68 times while eating gets old."
Toybox Bistro,1,"We would have enjoyed this place had it not been for a sign that read ""Toybox short bus tour 2017. ""So they think it's funny to refer to themselves as the special needs people that take the smaller bus to school? This day and age who thinks it's funny to make fun of special needs???!!! If it means something else I would love to hear. So the meal....The server was fun and funny.  He  forgot our appetizer though. My son's hot dog was awesome. My meatloaf not so much.  It was not very good at all!!But the server made up for the so so food. I work at a local hotel and thought - ok I would send people here just for the atmosphere. Till I looked over my daughter's shoulder and saw that sign.  Now anytime a guest checks in I tell them to stay away.  Disgraceful"
Toybox Bistro,4,Great new staple in the Huntsville area. Located off Jordan lane in the old Beauregards restaurant.  It's convenient to both Huntsvillians and Madison residents. The inside has a gamer type atmosphere and there are toys used as decor all over the rooms. The menu mostly had burgers and things of the like. I ended up ordering the lobster Mac and cheese sandwich. It's a bit pricey but... Yum! The restaurant also has an excellent variety of beers on tap. The staff was super helpful and friendly and our overall experience was nice. Definitely will try again!
Toybox Bistro,5,"Pretty cool local and eccentric place. Deb is AMAZING and took good care of me. She told me about the special of the day: Messy A** Meatball sub and let me tell you... this was order WITHOUT bread and it was THE BEST MEATBALL ""sandwich"" I've ever had. I had NO SELF CONTROL and are all of it to the point of exhaustion! It was worth it to be bent over the bar top. I will be going back. And Deb is such an amazing person! I'm excited to come back."
Toybox Bistro,3,"Wowza. This is an interesting place!  The waitress will start off by telling you that they don't serve vegetables and all of their meals are large and you don't want to know the calories. You can smell that anyway when you walk through the door of the plaza.  If you go try the hotdogs woth everything on it or try the chicken for a different twist. They do offer a side salad if your team is going and you don't want to eat your day's worth of calories in one sitting.  They've got kids toys on the walls, hanging from the ceilings and in the windows. Everything here is sticky too. Go for the experience, but make sure you're hungry for some different kind of comfort food."
Toybox Bistro,4,Great little place with unique food choices that are very tasty. Would highly recommend
Toybox Bistro,5,"Came in awhile back with boyfriend, we got an order of Queso which was really good then for main course we got the Meatloaf and Huntsville hot chicken sandwich. Sandwich was huge and the meatloaf was incredibly flavorful. The Waitress we had was so welcoming and friendly, sadly can't remember her name! We left a big tip because she was excellent. Atmosphere is incredibly unique, definitely a MUST on places in Huntsville!!!"
Toybox Bistro,4,"We found this through Yelp. Our waiter was great funny and sometimes the cook. He was well versed in the menu and even invented some of the sandwiches. We had several appetizers ( wings, buffalo chicken ragoon, fried pickles, fried mac n cheese) along with burger, and chicken bacon sandwich with warm potato salad. To start the pickles are local for the fried pickles, they are greasy but the are delicious.( They sell the pickles at Publix, forgot to get some before leaving town). The lagoon was different but ok. The wings were on the smaller side but ok.  Everyone raved about the fried Mac n cheese but we were not fans, too crispy and hard to eat. The burger was very good and the chicken was also. The warm potato salad was ok still like it cold better. Overall a fun place to have lunch and plenty of fun stuff to look at all around you. Their story on the back of the menu is also Great!. Our waiter made our afternoon even better."
Toybox Bistro,5,"What an amazing restaurant! Let's manage some expectations, this is a Nerd/Geek/Star Wars/Gundam/Comic Book themed location. With that said, the food is truly phenomenal!! I had some fried pickles and the Bruiser burger (black and Bleu) with an apple pie for dessert. The pickles were the best I've ever had, locally made with a hint of sweet. The burger was Juicy and flavorful... Couldn't put it down! I wanted to take a pic of the pie but I ate it faster than my phone shutter could operate. The decor is truly exquisite, a memorable and nostalgic trip down any nerd/geeks history.  The staff and owners are amazingly friendly and welcoming. I know every time I come back to Huntsville, this will be a mandatory stop."
Toybox Bistro,3,"I've been disappointed three times and had a good experience once. The recipes are strange. I normally like strange, but the flavor combos seem like they are trying way too hard. On one occasion, I walked for explanation on a burger on the menu and the server was stumped. Definitely need to better train the staff if unique menu items are going to be offered. Bottom line: I won't go out of my to go back."
Toybox Bistro,5,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in, but from the size of the crowd I had an idea it was good. Boy is it. I got the Pot Roast Sundae, and it was fabulous. Very large portions, creamy mashed potatoes and the meat was tender as a mother's love. Excellent choice."
Toybox Bistro,5,Great atmosphere huge portions! It was stressed you will not leave hungry. They have great specials weekly and on Wednesday drink specials. Highly recommend I'll be back and recommend to everyone
Toybox Bistro,4,"Service is always on point! Super nice, very knowledgeable, and on their service game! The food here though just isn't my thing. I've tried many items and nothing just stuck out for me or was fantastic."
Toybox Bistro,5,"Shout out to Greg, the master host of hosts and to Heather, from what I can tell the master of all things. Found on Yelp as staying in Huntsville for a couple of days. Customer service is king here, and the king is well versed. From the second we walked in to the second we left those two made our entire trip worth it. The decor is designed for those who frequent your local video game store, not the soccer mom who visited Gamestop once and thinks all systems are called Nintendos. Not to leave out the food...the Pork Eggrolls are touched by an angel. Queso is ok. Pot Roast is delicious. Lobster grilled cheese. I mean, what do you want. Lobster. Cheese. Heat. Its yum. Beer list is eclectic and filled with tasty choices. I'm typing all this looking at the leftover half wondering how my mom will take the news I died overeating shellfish and cheese. That's all folks! Stop in. Eat. Drink. Don't die."
Toybox Bistro,5,"We visited the Toybox Bistro in May 2019.  We had just arrived in Huntsville and were driving around looking for a place to eat and this is what we chose based on the Yelp reviews.  My husband is a bit of a star wars nerd so the ambiance really struck us and the food?  I had the fried chicken quesadilla with the cold potato salad and I kept saying I have to stop eating only because it was pretty late and I don't like eating late in the evening but I could not put this quesadilla down.  My husband had the pot roast sandwich with the hot potato salad.  I thought the cold potato salad was better.  Both meals were amazing and really filling we couldn't finish it all.  Really cool and different place, put this on your list if you visit Huntsville!"
Toybox Bistro,2,"My wife and I were looking for something different. I opened my trusty Yelp app and this is what came up. There's no way reading these reviews wouldn't peak your interests at least a little. Honestly, I was thinking of way out there type décor but it wasn't that far. We went on a Saturday night about 7pm. We were seated right away. It wasn't crowded. Right off the bat we liked the novelty type décor and the staff. We really liked the laid back atmosphere the staff created. Now the food, We ordered the ""Wicked Fried Pickles"" as a appetizer. I like that they were different but I wasn't crazy about the flavor. My wife loved them. She said it tasted like Bread and Butter pickles with spicy breading.  I wasn't crazy about them but the wife loved them. so you need to try them. My wife ordered the Beef Tips with mac and cheese and loaded baked potato salad. I ordered chicken tenders, mac and cheese and chili. Beef tips - My wife didn't like the flavor and they were under cooked (MR) so I ended up eating them. I wasn't impressed. They were tender but underwhelming. Chicken tenders - nothing special. They were just standard fried chicken tenders. Mac and Cheese -- points for the cooking them like a waffle. We both thought this was very creative but the taste was just bad, in our opinion. It's a hard crunchy waffle type Mac and Cheese. You can really only taste the crunchy parts and not enough actual M&C. Chili- my wife tried it and she didn't like it and told me i would hate it so i skipped it.  Loaded baked potato salad - I liked it but my wife didn't. It was like most of the loaded bake potato-salad sides I've tried before. Overall, we were disappointed with the food but the loved the staff. I really want to like this place but the our initial impression wasn't good. I'm on the fence with this place - the staff were awesome, service was also really good, the overall attitude of everyone was fantastic but the food was marginal."
Toybox Bistro,3,"Stopped in for lunch with my crew after reading an article on the best burgers in Huntsville.  It's a litte hole in the wallish, with a little lighting and cool toys. The place kind of has Supperhero vibes. We started with the poutine fries which came with gravy and queso fresco and they were really good. We ordered burgers and a grilled cheese. Grilled cheese was a hit my kid enjoyed it. The burgers were good too, nice size and good seasoning oh i also tried the grilled potatoe salad which was good too. Downer was the bacon on our burgers was cold and the egg on mine was overcooked. Overall we will be back to try something else!"
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,5,"The first time I came here (during the first 2 weeks of opening) I was NOT impressed. Tonight, however, made up for that visit and gave me something to sing about. Tonight's meal of .5 lb shrimp, .5 lb snow crab legs, corn and potatoes were definitely on point. I feel a food coma coming on. Great job you all. And, the curbside attendants were exceptional as well."
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,5,I'm from Texas and saw a fellow Texan who ate here and had to try. I thought I posted a review but didn't so here I am. This was the closest I've had here for Cajun seafood and I was ecstatic! Seafood mix 5/5 So flavorful. Something I really missed back home. I was super happy to find something similar. I loved the food. Shrimps were bit on the drier side but the rest was tasty. Oyster basket 5/5 Really great batter. Well seasoned. Fries were hot and tasty. I enjoyed it very much. Will be back soon!
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,5,To begin with food was amazing. I was craving some seafood and Yelp suggested this one which I'm glad it did. Customer service was good I had ordered through phone it was kind of late and I hate being that customer but I ordered when they had 30 minutes left to close. Though I asked if I could still order and they said yes. Moreover now back to the food lol very tasty I got the combo of fried Shrimp with cajun fries which were so incredibly delicious. What I also like is the how they packed everything up very cute little box and bag. I also I went on a Sunday and they had mimosas on special all day long didn't check the price though. Moreover if y'all are craving seafood especially shrimp I highly recommend trying this place out so worth it.
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,4,"I love seafood. And I love when I get to experience a seafood restaurant that serves great seafood. I also know that when you go to a seafood restaurant, especially a new one,there will be a wait.So I ventured out on Valentines Day (I know) to eat at Pier 88. As I drove up, I noticed where it is positioned, there is ample parking and walking to the restaurant ranges from a short jaunt to a couple of meters. I happened to get a place right up front. Opening the door gave me a feeling of being on the coast; it wasn't an esoteric smell, but a smell of seafood being cooked and eaten. Good memories flooded my mind of sitting on a pier and getting a boil and beer, watching the boats travel past while enjoying the sunset.When I came to the Maitre D, she asked my phone number and name. The phone number surprised me, so I gat her my 'burner' phone number (can't be too careful). She explained that I would receive a text when a table was ready. Let me say that it took about 20 mins for that text to come through, but being Valentines Day and it is a new restaurant, I expected to wait longer than that. While waiting I noticed the Happy Hour board and saw that the prices were very reasonable! I also had enough time to get into an existential conversation about heroes vs mentors. As my phone buzzed to alert me the table was ready, I moved forward and was shown a table in the main dining room which had ample table space and a lovely island pagoda type feel. Our waitress was pleasant and friendly laughing at my short jokes and getting our orders down. It was busy but there wasn't a lot of confusion with the waitstaff...they maneuvered through and around the dining room with precision.There was about a ten minute wait until the popcorn shrimp appetizer arrived, but we were given a status to let us know it was coming. It was really good! Not over seasoned and not bland, we talked and smacked until our next course.Now, I will say that when it comes to Low Country Boils, I am somewhat of a snob. I have have them from South Carolina to the Keys, and from Florida to California. I know what a great one is, and I know what an absolutely horrid one is. When it came to the table, it is wrapped in a plastic bag and placed on a metal tray with that accoutrements in the bucket. I also loved the fact that we were given an extra set of gloves; this was going to get messy! I ordered the garlic butter (didn't feel like the spicy boil this time, wanted to taste the flavor of the seafood) and I was not disappointed. There is an abundance of food included, and to the seafood scarfer, it was heaven. The shrimp was not overcooked, the crab legs were hand-breakable with easy meat access (some places don't cook it well so the meat sucks to the shell).After getting the 'to-go' boxes (it is a lot of food!), I got the bill. I am not going to kid you, it takes a little bit out of your pocket, but this is a place I don't mind paying. I had a wonderful experience and will go back again for not only the food, but the Happy Hour as well. My hope is that when the crowds die down, we receive the same service that I received initially."
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,4,"I was in the mode for seafood and this popped up on Yelp. Ratings are mixed but high enough to try it. This was my first visit. I arrived and was told the wait time was (roughly) 30 minutes. There were a lot of people waiting but there were a lot of empty tables. Staffing issues? They took my information and I got a text. With the text I cloud see where i was in the queue (honestly for this place the only way it could be done)As I went to take a seat I noticed they have a To-Go deal so I ordered from there. Your primary options here are boiled or fried seafood plus raw oysters. I ordered 1/2 lb of boiled shrimp (without heads) & the fried oyster (a personal favorite) basket. The shrimp came in a bag with half an ear of corn on the cob & a single potato. (Had asked for shrimp only). I ordered Cajun spice, medium heat. The shrimp was good, not overcooked. The spice was ok, the heat seemed low. Overall no complaints. The oysters came in a small box with fries (you have several side options).  The oysters were a decent size, the breading wasn't overpowering so it was a win. Overall the food was win. The complaints - the place is extremely noisy. It's not a place to go and have a nice quiet dinner. I'm not sure I would meet some friends here. It's just too noisy.When I tried to order I could barely hear the options and the girl wasn't overly interested in speaking up. The whole entry process is hampered by the noise. I think you could come up with a better crowd flow process that would not be so wasteful. It took nearly 45 minutes to get my To-Go order. I ordered about 5:15 and got in my truck at 6. No kidding My complaints, to me, are substantial and will affect when / how I come back. Overall, I'm a fan of the food but not crazy about the noise. I definitely recommend that you come try it."
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,5,"I've narrowed down 3 restaurants here in Huntsville that are my favorite and this Place is one of them! We visited when they first opened, they didn't have a yelp profile yet, so I couldn't share all of this awesomeness my first visit. I'm addicted to the low country boil, mild doused in Pier 88 seasoning! Decided to skip out on the sausage but thats okay for you non porkers! They will gladly give you more corn and potatoes. GLADLY. Snow crab, shrimp, potatoes and an egg. This is probably one of the best restaurants to happen to Huntsville in a while. I can't wait to get back!"
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,4,"Visited a few times now and the quality of the food has remained pretty consistent. As a fairly new seafood business, wait times haven't been too bad. During our first visit, shortly after their soft opening, our low county boils were lukewarm, but the temps were right during the next visit. Food wise - I've only tried the low country boil and the calamari appetizer. Calamari was just okay, but the low country boils are great with a generous portion. I HIGHLY recommend the 88 sauce as your low country seasoning for FULL flavor and if you like your food to have some heat, try the hot and the extra hot spice levels. Extra hot if you need you sinuses cleared (lol).Bar drinks have been either a hit or miss. Plentiful seating and very open atmosphere. I recommend stopping by the Pier."
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,1,"I've tried this place twice just to make sure that I wasn't being to judgmental about the food. I've order the seafood boil twice and it has no flavor. Yes the juice in the bag looks great but it's nothing but oil and butter mixed with red seasoning. The shrimps are soaked in it, but at least the one crab leg that's in the bag takes up for the whole bag. I'll wait another 3-6 months to try again until then I'll keep going to Andy's seafood market"
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,3,"Finally they are open.  So first time figuring try them.  Wait was bit long for server but wasn't crowded.  S/o getting the catfish plate and I am getting the house special boil.  They were nice to swap the potato and corn out for extra eggs since I am doing keto.  The flavoring I got is the 88 special and with hot seasoning.  I was able to get some extra hot on the side.Wait staff seems bit overwhelmed as the are bit slow on checking on people as it picks up.  Also food seems to be taking a bit as been waiting for about 30 minutes for it.  So don't be in a rush.  We just got told another 5 minutes after an hour wait on fried fish. Supposedly they from the manager ""they got backed up on the fries due to happy hour.""  They going to need to fix this. Food taste great at least but did not get my side of extra hot to try and the fries my S/O got were supposed to be Cajun and for sure was not.Right now the only thing that will bring me back here is the food as been dying for a seafood place otherwise they have to many growing pains.  Also the fish not bone free but they don't mention it."
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,5,"Oh my goodness! If your looking for a BOMB seafood spot , this is the go to place! It was absolutely amazing to me .. from the wings and hush puppies down to the main attraction the seafood boil.. it was hot and the season was impeccable! I will definitely recommend this place to any seafood lover! Only downfall is that it was literally so packed that we had to wait an hour! But that was okay lol we took the kids to stars and strikes for a little bit to play so it was all okay! Our waitress was extremely nice , we even had leftovers which was even greater lol ! PLEASE GO TO THIS SPOT! It's a little pricey but it's worth it ! They have the low country seafood boil for 26$ but I had to be extra and order lobsters which were 14$ a piece and a pound of mussels! It was just great! My family and I will be back for sure!"
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,2,Hmmm so we stopped in  for dinner and were able to call ahead and place oyr name on the list whuch was awesome cause we knew it would be crowded since it hasn't been open long. We started with mozzarella sticks that came out with ice cold marinara ‍ Then we ordered chicken strips which they let you know will take long cause it's fried ‍ uhh ok. Tgey were blah and oddly soft but hey they are a seafood spot. So we ordered to pots one kn garlic and the other in their signature 88 sauce and to be honest it was meh. The crab kegs were super small and over steamed. It also had  shrimp  and sausage which was your basic type. Not the seafood spot for me!
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,3,"I love seafood and had high hopes for this place to be amazing. The service was great but the Low Country Boil was underwhelming , it was very watery which washd  out the flavoring. If I go back I'll get something fried instead."
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,4,"We got in on a Friday night with only a 30 minute wait, not bad at all since it's just recently opened.  Fish, crab, shrimp and sausage were all great and the portions were very ample.  The coleslaw was not my favorite.  Our food did not come out all together, but our server eventually got it all to us.  The service was spotty, but the restaurant was very crowded.  Will have to give them another try, I think this has great potential."
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,3,Decent seafood but I expect a lot more based on the reviews.  I am from Louisiana so I may be a bit spoiled.  Seafood was not in proportion to the amount of sausage that was on the plates.  Was more like barbecue seafood than it was boil spicy seafood.
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,5,"Great low country boil flavor. We had the 88 Special spice and medium heat. My lips still have a nice lingering burn 5 minutes after eating. Bibs, gloves, and tools for tearing into it all."
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,2,This is my second time coming here and I have to say the service is SLOWWWWW. There wasn't a wait and my boyfriend and I were seated immediately so that was a plus. Our server Charles was attentive and helped us pretty quick at first...and then ghosted is after he helped us the first go 'round. This is the kicker folks...it took over 15 minutes to get our beers and then 45 minutes to get our appetizer out. Me being a server...NOT GOOD. Then on our second order of beers they forgot to order my boyfriends beer. Ehhhh...the food was pretty greasy..AND COLD..wellll everything but the fish..last time coming here...don't waste your time or money...not worth it.
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,5,"We've  been waiting eagerly for Pier 88 to open here in Huntsville.  and it was definitely worth the wait.  We happened upon their ""soft opening"". The food was awesome... alot of food for the $. We had the Low Boil and the Pier88 chicken wings We will be coming back regularly."
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,3,"The buffalo wings were average. Waffle sweet potatoes were average as well, could have used salt but salt wasn't provided (I noticed that neither  salt nor pepper were on any of the tables). My husband enjoyed the low country boil but mentioned it was a little over cooked. Our server was very nice but super busy which is why I did not ask for salt. There weren't many salad options. I love seafood - there are too many other restaurants in the area with excellent and delicious food choices to  give this restaurant another visit."
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,4,I definitely enjoyed the food it was much better than I expected. Me and my co workers will definitely come back. I had the crab boil I think which included everything.
Pier 88 Boiling Seafood & Bar,1,"What a joke! Hardly any seating, waiting for over 30 at 4 in the afternoon when the place is half empty and they don't call names in order. No way!"
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,Just wonderful southern home cooking!  Reminds me of my mamas cooking. Highly  recommend you try this place. Done in or carry out!
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,"I had heard about Betty Maes before we even moved to Alabama last summer. After two months in the state, I finally had to try it. Glad I did because it's the only true Southern food I've eaten out here. Meals are cooked to order, which is worth the wait. The fried chicken had a tasty, crispy crust while the meat stayed juicy. The fried green tomatoes are my favorite! The Mac n Cheese was tasty but the red velvet cake is what keeps me coming back. Will have to taste something we next time I stop by."
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,3,"I wish they would pay closer attention to their orders! 2nd time trying them 1st time my order was missing the cake and the 2nd time it was missing chicken and the 2md order totally wrong! Asked for 2 wing a leg. Mac n cheese, and pinto beans! We got a breast and leg with cabbage vs mac n cheese! Also our 2nd time the fried food was soggy because it was submerged in cabbage juice!"
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,Absolutely delicious.  Love the new location on North Parkway & Oakwood.  Probably one of the best fried chicken in town.  Turnip Greens are up there as well.  Love the food and the hospitality.
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,2,"I came here because of the reviews. I really like their set up, how you can see the kitchen and all. Everything appears to be made fresh to order, and portions are great. So they get a star for these facts alone.But I just wasn't a fan of the food, objectively it just wasn't cooked with any skill. I had the fried catfish with mac n cheese and potatoes with banana pudding. The catfish was probably seasoned well but I could hardly tell because it was over battered and overcooked. The batter was thicker than the fish and was hard, not crispy/crunchy, big difference. The mashed potatoes and gravy were pretty bland, that surprised me. The Mac n cheese is normal and nothing special. The banana pudding was good, but I've never eaten a bad banana pudding in my life.I really wanted to like this place, and in fact I feel like I may have caught them on a bad day or something. I'm definitely open to trying them again if I get the chance."
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,"You know what I DON'T like? Soul food.But you know where I'll gladly eat it? Betty Mae's.I get away with amateurish food critique in a lot of things;  I snob on sushi, wine, barbacoa, classic French.. and a few trends here and there.  But with soul food, it's deeply personal. I didn't know it at the time but I spent almost the first 2 decades of living in a soul food mecca: between 2 grandmothers, a church and a half of extended family, all low-key competitors in the best ""from scratch"" recipes--every Sunday was some form of a soul food showdown in my little piece of an even smaller-than-you'd-imagine hometown.But that's back story.Fast forward to a rainy late spring day, tornado sirens within earshot to this neighborhood gem mildly reminiscent of Freddy's from House of Cards.  The kool-aid, sweet tea, lemonade drink trio and the friendly faces in the kitchen took me a few decades and also reminded me of why ""mom and pop"" stops will forever be on my foodie road tour. But I grabbed the fried chicken the first time around and it ensured many more visits... It's damn good.  The collard greens were a hit as well and I doubled up on fried okra and realized maybe I just didn't like bad soul food. I've been back a few times since the first and I'll say the cabbage and fried catfish areal highlights as well. They have daily specials and I'm planning to come back for oxtails... once the weather and my schedule coordinate.You're better off not mentioning soul food as a suggestion for lunch and expect me to oblige but... if you gotta have it and you're in Huntsville, I won't fight you if it's Betty Mae's."
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,"Elle E J and Mike S are spot on, best soul food around.I think sometimes soul food joints, like a lot of other restaurants, end up serving subpar food because the food takes time to prepare so it sits around and overcooks. I think the beauty of Betty Mae's only being open a few hours a day is that the food stays fresh and delicious.The value is crazy good. I'd say go with the fried chicken or fried pork chop, and then pick your favorite side. I don't like beans on their own and I have never liked black eyed peas. Get either of them here, they are both outstanding!! The mac and cheese is great.  I don't like okra. I like Betty Mae's okra.We've had them cater office events, and they have never let us down, and we take out of towners there. Going for lunch may make you want a nap, but it is worth it."
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,"Ate here with a big group at lunch on a busy Friday.  The line was out the door & it was a bit if a wait, but it was worth every minute. For $9.99, you get a choice of six meats, two sides, cornbread or roll, a choice of six desserts and a bottomless drink selection of non carbonated options like tea, lemonade & Koolaid.   Everybody in our group ordered different things.  The catfish was perfectly battered in corn meal & fried to the perfect crisp.  Their 'Jesus eggs"" (deviled eggs to us heathens) were a little taste of heaven.  If I was at a church buffet & those eggs were on it,  I'd be slipping back for seconds & thirds!  Pinto beans, fried okra, cornbread, fried chicken, chicken fried steak & greens were all just like granny used to make.  It was a happy, friendly crowd.  Service was outstanding & the owner was working hard & making sure her staff was on top of things.  Betty Mae, who was the owner's grandmother, would be proud.  Hungry & proud.  Thus is a keeper."
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,"Man, what a deal and what a selection for soul food. This is the place if you want to get some killer soul food staples. You choose a meat/protein, two ""veggies"" (really, sides), a dessert, and a drink for under $10. I chose the fried catfish, fried okra, yams, and sweet potato pie with some unsweetened tea. Everything was very flavorful and fresh when we received our food. It doesn't come out immediately - they're making it fresh!I will say that everything skews really sweet (yams, lemonade, sweet tea, etc.) but the savory dishes were perfect. I even got to try some of the neckbones that they were serving for the day and they were stewed and cooked to perfection. Definitely a hole in the wall - you get here from driving down a residential street and feel like you're going the wrong way but man, you did get yourself a home cooked soul food meal!"
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,Really good southern dishes!!!! Turnips Greens are great!!Must try if you're in the area
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,"This is simply a charming place to eat. It's a little hole in the wall. But it is a spot for that ""home cooked meal"" type of dining.I recommend going for lunch when they do a meat plus two side dishes for $9. You can't go wrong with either their fried chicken or fried catfish. The fried okra is pretty solid as well.If you're in Huntsville, I suggest giving the place a try. It will be worth your time."
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,4,1st time here.. went in when they were about too close so couldn't get upset because they didn't have everything on the menu.. I learned about the sweet tea and lemonade I'm from Vegas so sweet tea goes with every thing.. the Red Koodaid was good bit 2 sweet but aye I'm in the south so no complaints I'll just drink up.. good customer service I'll have to come back and sit and enjoy the place..
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,4,"Classic comfort soul food in an authentic local setting, served by a friendly staff, will not disappoint. Housed in a small modest shop in the middle of an older neighborhood, sits Betty Mae's. Walk into the kitchen and see the cooks hand-breading and frying each piece of chicken fresh. Choose from a daily menu on the board of specials. A meat, two sides, bread, drink and desert for only $7.99-what a deal!  We selected salmon cakes and fried chicken with sides of fried green tomatoes, green beans, collars greens and coke slaw.  We selected corn bread, ice tea and lemon cake and sweet potato pie.  We sipped our tea and waited for our lunch in a small adjacent dining area playing reruns of an old Western on the television.  The food came quickly. The meat servings were enormous.  The pair of salmon cakes were 6 inch in diameter each with a crispy charred coating. They were delicious. The chicken, also generous two pieces, coated with a crispy batter was hot and juicy. The green beans and collards were sweet and flavorful. The fried green tomatoes were coated with a corn meal breading. The corn bread was equally delicious. We also enjoyed the lemon cake-a kind of bundt cake with a sugar glaze. The sweet potato pie was definitely homemade with a flaky crust.  As we ate, the place filled with locals and tourists. The manager stopped by our table to make sure we had everything we needed.  If you're looking for a taste of the old South, stop by Betty Mae's!"
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,4,"Betty Mae's has been on my bucket list for many months and I finally stopped by for lunch. I really love the ""mom & pop"" style and the home cooking. The restaurant in located in an old house and you walk into the kitchen and place your order at a simple counter. You actually feel the heat from the large multi-burner stove as you place your order. Nothing fancy here.The menu is a white marker board with the daily specials. You choose the meat and side dishes, pay, and sit down in an adjacent room. Nothing fancy here. The menu shows they have a wide variety of meats and sides dishes. For just $7.99 you get a meat, two sides, a choice of corn bread or roll, drink, and a dessert. Very reasonable.The dining room is just an open room with a mix-match of tables and chairs. Most don't match and many are unbalanced and need a wad of napkins to keep steady. Nothing fancy here.Every order is custom made and a group of 8 people were in front of me, so it took some time for my order to brought to my table. There are no dishes to clean at Betty Mae's; all food is served in styrofoam 3-compartment to-go food containers. Nothing fancy here.The food portions are large; a surprise given how cheap the food is. I chose meat loaf; yes I am an offical meat loaf connoisseur...I have a meat loaf badge!! The meat loaf was good, but fell apart and had too many onions. The onions were not sauteed prior to insertion into the meat loaf so I had to pick around the meat loaf to miss the large onion pieces. The mash potatoes were good and covered in a nice gravy, however they were a little lumpy. The candied yams were AWESOME!!!!!  Maybe the best ever! The corn bread was good but a little dry and I didn't see any butter to add moisture to the corn bread. The chocolate cake, wrapped in cellophane, was very good! The drinks are self-serve and you have choice between sweet tea, unsweet tea, lemonade, and kool-aid...yes...kool-aid.  Isn't that cool? Where can you get kool-aid these days? Made me feel like a kid again.So even though a few things could be improved, I had a wonderful lunch experience. I need to compliment the employees as they were super friendly and courteous. The is nothing fancy at Betty Mae's, but you will have a great affordable lunch experience."
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,1,"Ok, first off let me say the food is really good so that's not why I'm giving this business one star. So I go there today and the nice lady to my order and my total was 10.93, I normally always pay with my card and leave a tip. So I noticed that my original total was cleared out and .50 was on the screen. I looked at her and then the screen and she was like ""come on slow computer"" so when she gave me the receipt to sign I noticed that my total was now 11.43. So I said, wait you said 10.93 was the total so where did the .50 come from? She said, that's the pre-tip. I said what? Ok, I have no problem tipping but I think that's kind of sneaky for you to do that. So everyone coming to Betty Mae's please ask for your end receipt (I had to ask for mine) because fifty cents isn't much but if that's added to every customer's tab it adds up. I'll be paying with cash if I go back!"
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,4,This is soul food. Not blown away but enjoyable. Fast service and very casual atmosphere.  Off the Main Street in a house.
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,"Went to Betty Mae's on a Wednesday when the special of the day was neckbones....and OMG. They were absolutely delicious (and falling off the bone!) I had the cabbage as a side, also very tasty! They were not over smothered or had a ton of seasoning, they were just right. I will definitely be back to try the liver and oxtails!"
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,"Great fried chicken.  Friend said the oxtails were good.  Yams were sweet goodness, corn bread was good.  They also have Kool aid and homemade lemonade.  Along with Walton's, nest southern food in town.  Quick service, good prices too."
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,4,"Loved the food here. I ordered catfish, chicken, sweet potatoes, Mac & Cheese and Kool-Aid (took me wayyyy back to my childhood days). The catfish and chicken were superb! Both dishes were seasoned to perfection, crispy and fresh. The sweet potatoes were delicious -- reminded me of gooooooood southern cooking. The mac & cheese tasted good, but was nothing special. I also ordered cornbread and lemon cake. Both were really good. Tell me where in the country can you get a good soul food meal; meat, two sides, drink, bread and dessert for $7.99?????? The meal was well worth it. The only reason I took off one star is because, I arrived at the resturant at 4pm on Sunday and could not be served....because they ran out of food :-( WTH?? Otherwise, I was very happy."
Betty Mae’s Restaurant,5,"Found this place while heading from Louisville to Nee Orleans and SO GLAD we did. Best southern food I've ever had hands down. I had the fried pork chop with collard greens, Mac and cheese and corn bread with sweet tea and peach cobbler for $10. Amazing."
Urban Cookhouse,5,Family 4 Meal was outstanding! I was especially impressed by our curbside server Tori who was outstanding!
Urban Cookhouse,5,"I always love urban cookhouse. It's clean, and you get PLENTY of good tasting food for your money. The employees are always so welcoming cheerful. I went this time and I ordered the pepper patch salad (w/o) cheese and added the lime marinated steak and a side of rice to it (I love to make a salad bowl out of anything, if I could). It was delicious. The roasted jalapeño vinaigrette was so good that I asked to buy a bottle of it for home. The orange roll was awesome as always.My date ordered the chipotle pork plate, but changed the meat to chicken (they still put chipotle sauce on top). It looked great. His cane with a side of broccoli salad and cheddar pasta. Both were delicious (I tried them). Only thing is that we wish he was given an orange roll instead of the sliced white bread."
Urban Cookhouse,4,"The staff here is super friendly and attentive and that's mainly the reason for this review. While the food isn't terrible, it also didn't blow me away. For starters, make sure you check in via Yelp to get your free brown sugar brownie. It definitely is a nice treat to enjoy after (or before - I'm not judging) your meal. We ordered the Chipotle Braised Pork sliders and the Urban Cowboy sandwich. The pork was juicy and tender with a nice flavor although I wouldn't really say it had any chipotle flavor to it. The portion size was a little small and wasn't filling so keep that in mind if you're hungry! The urban cowboy was a larger sandwich on a French roll. The steak was decently cooked (medium) but a little chewy. There was a lot of aioli on the sandwich but I'm a sauce kinda girl so I didn't mind it. Onions and peppers come premixed do you can't separate them out so keep that in mind as well. For sides we had the fresh fruit and the rice pilaf. The fruit was a mixture of cantaloupe, strawberries, grapes and pineapple. Rice pilaf was cooked nicely and had a rich buttery/salt level. Compared to most places in the Bridge Street area I would definitely try this place again."
Urban Cookhouse,5,"We had them cater our neighborhood. They were amazing. The food was delicious, as was the DIY sangria kit."
Urban Cookhouse,5,"OMGosh-- My favorite new find in Huntsville!  Hip, trendy inside, super friendly staff and the best part (of course) is the food!  I had the turkey crunch sandwich with broccoli salad. 'Which has a bit of a kick but oh so good!  And the salad... I can't wait to come back and get more... oh wait!... they have it in take-home sizes!!!   Gonna grab one before I leave. Make sure to use the check-in to get the brown sugar brownie. Perfect ending to an awesome experience!  Can't wait to return!"
Urban Cookhouse,5,"This normally isn't my kind of place, I'm pretty anti salad lol.But the urban cowboy sandwich was just awesome. I normally don't do sandwiches because I can make most things at home, but I'm really glad I ordered this one! I'm very impressed at how tender the steak was on that sandwich, to the point where it wasn't messy, as most steak sandwiches tend to be. That plus the aioli and lime seasoning just finish it off perfectly. The mac n cheese is also phenomenal. It tastes like they make it there fresh. If they don't then they do a heckuva job faking it, haha!Prices are reasonable as well!"
Urban Cookhouse,5,"Really nice place. I thought that was more like a regular restaurant, but in fact you order at the counter and they bring you the food. Food tasted really good and freshly baked. Nice flavor combinations. The baked cookie topped with ive cream was definitely my favorite hahaNice backup plan for any weekly lunch in HSV"
Urban Cookhouse,5,"Good, healthy, heart friendly food. Service fast & friendly. I had the lime steak. It was delicious and tender. Lots of onions though. Reasonable prices."
Urban Cookhouse,5,"Very good food, good service, and clean. I loved everything about it, and will be back. New to the area, and the local places are killing it! I got the chicken buffalo wrap and the roasted veggies. Everything was yummy and hot."
Urban Cookhouse,4,"This isdefinitely a local favorite and prime time at lunch. It is located in a shopping mall so it's enjoyable to stop at. Try the variety of salads, sandwiches or restaurant favorites. You must get the orange rolls and try their freshly made lemonade.  They are quick and the food is fresh. I'm not a huge fan of the smokey flavored cuban pork or the citrus dressing on the salad, but everything else was amazing. Try something new today?"
Urban Cookhouse,4,"Visited UC recently on a team building lunch as part of a group of 4. I had the grilled chicken special ""Served with rice pilaf, garden salad and a warm orange roll"" and I subbed broccoli salad for the rice pilaf and gave the warm orange roll away (trying to avoid bread).Oh, be sure and check in with yelp to get your free brownie!The service is you stand in line, two people are available to take your order, you fill your own drinks (or get the chilled options that include beer and wine, etc.) and take the number to your table. The service is very friendly! The staff bring your food and circulate among the restaurant and patio to offer refills, extra napkins, etc. They were friendly and did a great job. The chicken was good, with good flavor and texture, the broccoli salad was good, and the salad itself was good. The restaurant is clean and new with the garage door that opens to a small, partially covered patio. That's where we sat. My team lead had the Urban Cowboy and I don't recall what my other coworkers had. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food.Maybe it's because I try to eat low fat, low carb and high protein - I just didn't see the draw to this menu. Other things I noticed are the noise level was pretty high. I recall just plain garage style flooring and hard surfaces. Also, there are 2 coed bathrooms. I wish they had the ""occupied"" thing that goes from ""available"" to ""occupied"" when the door is locked. After enjoying a lot of their iced tea, I needed to use the restroom and felt like a creeper hanging out by and knocking on the two restroom doors when I could not hear if a person was in there or not. Other than that, it was a fine place to have a team/work lunch."
Urban Cookhouse,5,"Didn't know what to expect with this place, but was very impressed!! It's an order at the counter, wait for your food at the table type of place. I got the buffalo chicken wraps with fruit. The fruit was really fresh and sweet! My boyfriend got the cheese pasta as a side which I was very impressed with. Would definitely come back here for lunch!"
Urban Cookhouse,4,"The QuickNDirty: Good place to eat, a little pricier but good quality, clean place, good service, good iced-tea. Review: There are quite a few items to pick from in the menu from an Urban Cowboy sandwich to a Grilled Chicken Special. They have everything from wraps to sandwiches to plates. They have a great outside  seating area which is pet-friendly so that is a plus. The iced tea is really good and really fresh. This is a fast-casual type environment where you pay first, then the food it brought out to you. Some portions on some of the items leave less to be desired especially if you are really hungry. Go with a friend and enjoy each others company in a good environment. Pro Tip: Get the grilled chicken special meal. Its the same price as some of the other meals and you get more food that is good quality. Kids Review: Love the kids grilled chicken!"
Urban Cookhouse,1,The best thing on my plate was the 2 pieces of white bread out of the bag. The worst food I've ever attempted to eat. Had to fight the flies off the plate (yes I was inside). Won't be back. BBQ was wet and nasty Whitt's BBQ 1000% better.
Urban Cookhouse,5,Very fresh and healthy options at a good price as well! Definitely on my list of favorite restaurants in the area!
Urban Cookhouse,5,"There is a reason for all the great reviews!!! At first the menu didn't seem overly different or impressive but one the food hits your mouth you realize what's special, the flavor/freshness/perfection."
Urban Cookhouse,4,"This is a great place if you want to eat healthy and fresh! Located in Huntsville's Bridge Street Town Center, Urban Cookhouse emphasizes the farm to table style food concept. They have a fairly wide selection of wraps, salads, sandwiches, plates, and side orders to choose from. After contemplating the menu for a while, I ordered the wood fired shrimp kabob plate, and substituted the rice pilaf for roasted vegetables. The shrimp kabobs came with seasoned grilled shrimp and squash, and a side of fresh greens. All orders also came with a warm orange roll, a sweet buttery roll that serves as a great little dessert to end your meal. If you need a break from shopping, I'd recommend giving this place a try! I'd give it 5 stars, but it was a bit pricey (but less expensive than lots of other eating options at this mall)."
Urban Cookhouse,5,"Everything here is amazing, for both food and service. When visiting Huntsville I always visit the Urban Cookhouse. I was hooked from the first Berry Good Wrap. The food is fresh and seasoned to perfection"
Urban Cookhouse,3,"Mediocre food with prices that defy quantity,quality or service. The taste is not unique either. Makes you wonder what you are paying for."
Urban Cookhouse,1,"If zero stars can be given I would. We had it catered for work. We had ham with pineapple the ham was old! Dry chicken, the saltiest mac and cheese ever. The orange rolls were stale. I threw my food in the trash. Also several employees were talking that their stomach was hurting after that food. Lucky for me I grabbed something and ate. I WILL NOT GO TO THIS PLACE TO EAT! YUCK!!!"
Kamado Ramen,5,"This place is new, popular, and very small, which means you can expect crazy wait times when you show up. We went on a Sunday after church and arrived about 10 minutes before they opened ... and there were already people waiting in line. By the time the shop opened and we got up to the counter to order, the line was out the door and into the food garden area. It stayed packed the entire time we were there and it was difficult to move around if you didn't snag a spot at the bar or if you went to the drink machine. My husband and I both ordered the chicken ramen and a side of kara-age. My husband had never had ramen before (he tried pho and hated it), but he enjoyed the ramen. Next time he said he would order it without most of the toppings because he's picky. I really enjoyed the chicken ramen. The broth was great and everything was cooked perfectly. It was overall a great bowl of ramen that really hit the spot. The kara-age completely stole the spotlight, though. As another yelper said, they really are akin to little chicken nuggets covered in a spicy sauce. They are absolutely incredible. My husband and I have been dreaming longingly of having it again. The shop is in the Stovehouse Food Garden. It's tiny and only has a few seats inside, all of which overlook the cooking area, which is pretty neat. This place is so new that wait times are crazy and people can get annoying (we even had a guy try to cut us in line‍), but the food is definitely worth a visit and the kara-age is most definitely worth any wait."
Kamado Ramen,3,"So here's the thing. Or the 2 things:1. They put canned corn in the delicious gentle broth.  Because they do not use a slotted spoon to scoop up the corn, corn water floods the bowl of flavor treasures with the tinny flavor of Green Giant can-water. But with every complaint there should be a solution. So here's a solution:  use a slotted spoon!! 2. There are only 2 non-pork ramens on the menu. One is chicken and the other is vegetable.  In this day and age of plant-based eating, this is a bit shocking. So I asked for a yummy choice without the pork... but the employee said the pork items are actually cooked in a pork broth. That's hard to believe but here's a solution:  add more non-pork options.  Lots of mushrooms, ginger, garlic, green onions, tofu, bamboo shoots, kelp and sprouts would really be a hit. You already have all the ingredients except the tofu. Chipotle and Moe's increased their client base when they added tofu to their menu.  In the photo, you'll see our family bowls- 3 chicken, one vegetable.  Btw, the vegetable broth is    . So if you don't eat pork and you don't like spicy...but you do eat chicken, then you have ONE choice.  The cooks are inspirational and the cashiers are helpful and honest. The location is perfect for family fun (Stovehouse).  As for the flavors, with the exception of the corn-water infusion, it's pretty good. What I know now is to say ""no corn"".  Or... perhaps, ""did ya get a slotted spoon for the corn."""
Kamado Ramen,3,"Bottom line: really nice ramen, REALLY nice chicken, mediocre location.  Set in the middle of an old factory, Kamado is a pretty new place with a short menu.  Broth in the pork tonkatsu ramen was really nice, and the included egg was perfectly cooked, but it was basically just a soft boiled egg, not the soy braised version I'm used to seeing.  The pork was well cooked, but two thin very thin slices was a bit underwhelming.Ak, but the chicken kaarage.  Think of it as chicken nuggets with flavor!  Beautifully cooked, served with a nice sauce, in a portion size that was clearly Westernized (i.e., big) - very nice!  I would order this on its own in the future.My only complaint is that you have to hunt to find it.  The building has two parking lots, with unclear signage from the road.  If you park on the side of the building with the traffic light, you will not find the restaurant unless you ask one of the office drones (which I did).  Better signs (and even better directions on Yelp) absolutely needed.Don't get me wrong: the food was worth the hunt.  In the words of Saint Arnold: I'll be back!"
Kamado Ramen,4,"Picked up two spicy tontaksu, and a seaweed salad. I was so happy of the to go packaging that kept the noodles and other goodies out of the broth. Such good comfort food on a day I really needed it. I'm also VERY happy we finally have a ramen shop in Huntsville. We've had great ramen shops in other cities we have lived in, and I was really missing it. The pork slices were so good, and the egg was amazing. I don't know what they did to it to make it taste so great, but I loved it. I ordered online, and my order was ready in 15 minutes. Great job guys, and thank you for being open right now!"
Kamado Ramen,4,"I absolutely loved this place!! The ramen was great, fresh, and hearty. The lady at the counter gave great recommendations. I did not like the pork bun, super sticky and not as fluffy as I like my buns. Love the whole Stovehouse area. You can eat in or take it to go. The bowls are nice and disposable I was almost sad to throw it away. Can't wait to go back!"
Kamado Ramen,5,I like this place - cool ambiance good food- try the karage soooo yummy I had the spicy miso soup - so food my friend Bakari got the chicken rramen he loved it/ it's always packed but it's definitely for a goodReason - try  it out! It's modern cool and trendy! Good place to go on a date or with friends! Check out my pics!
Kamado Ramen,3,"Relative for the area, this isn't bad. It's not going to blow your socks off unless your only experience with ramen is of the instant variety.Everyone else in my party got the tonkotsu ramen so I chose the miso ramen. Miso ramen comes with the thicker eggy noodles. Tonkotsu comes with the thinner floury noodles. The noodles were cooked well. I was afraid that with the time to transport the ramen to seating outside, the noodles would have been mush. The broth wasn't overly salty and had some richness. It wasn't the most flavorful broth I've had but, relatively speaking, hit the spot.We tried three sides - gyoza, karaage, and takoyaki. My issue with these is that each dish is not normally spicy. Two of my party can't eat spicy so they had to try to eat around it. The gyoza was served with premade spicy soy dipping sauce. No other option was given. The karaage was covered in spicy sauce. The takoyaki was also covered in spicy sauce instead of plain Kewpie mayo. I like spicy things but I also like to know when I'm getting something spicy.If you don't want or can't eat spicy foods, learn from my experience and ask for the gyoza to be served with a mix of soy sauce and vinegar, the karaage not covered in sauce but served with a lemon wedge and dollop of Kewpie and the takoyaki to not be covered in spicy sauce but with plain Kewpie."
Kamado Ramen,5,"Great ramen. Very yummy. Wow. Okay, but for real this is a great ramen shop. I usually drive 2 hours to Nashville in order to have ramen, but now I don't have to do that anymore! Service is quick too. The place was packed, and I still got my order in ~10 minutes. 10/10 would recommend!"
Kamado Ramen,3,Impressed by the food but not the service. The boy taking my order wasn't friendly. Music was too loud. They forgot to charge us for something we ordered and then wanted to later on charge us. Just not great customer service. The ramen was really good. Spicy! But seemed to be the perfect amount. We also got the Kara-age and gyoza which were equally as good. Will be back and hopefully they can make a better impression next time.
Kamado Ramen,5,"Very yummy, lines outside the door, 25-30 min wait for food but the chefs are literally working as fast as they can to serve quality Ramen. Unfortunately, they forgot my soft boiled egg but I will not fault them for that! The pork belly bun is absolutely scrumptious! It's a must go spot in HSV! All the bowls are disposable and you can ask for a top if you want to take to go!"
Kamado Ramen,4,"I was very excited when I found out this place was opening up. *Food:Personally I liked the ramen, I have tried the kimchi ramen and the pork ramen and both were very good. I would say, if you have a very sensitive pallet to flavors then you can do the chicken. If you are  into big flavor skip the chicken ramen all together and get something more daring. Forks are available at the counter, you might have to ask someone to pass you one, other than that chop sticks are along the wall with napkins and spoons.*establishment:plays trendy music, a little too loud in my opinion, you have to scream your order to the lady at the counter. There is usually a line so be prepared to wait about 15 min. The staff in not overly nice but also not rude, the customer service is about 3 out of 5. The establishment have very limited seating so during cold periods sitting outside is a little tricky."
Kamado Ramen,5,"Oh yum!!! Love the fresh made noodles and all the fresh ingredients! For as busy as it was, they get your food out quickly! I highly recommend the kimchi ramen! In addition, great outdoor seating and many activities! Great place to bring the kids!"
Kamado Ramen,5,"So excited to be able to try Kamado Ramen before their official opening on Jan 2! I got the Spicy Miso and it was delicious. The broth was nice and flavorful with a decent helping of spice. It was spicy enough my nose was running and I had a satisfying burn in the back of my mouth, but it wasn't unpleasant by any means (this is coming from someone who likes spice but cant do insanely spicy things). The noodles were cooked perfectly and i enjoyed all the toppings, particularly the pork and fish cakes. I would recommend this place to any ramen lover!"
Kamado Ramen,4,"Several days after opening and there is still a long line out the door. ~25 minute wait for the food after ordering at the counter. The broth was great however the noodles were not the best. Paying with ApplePay and receiving a digital receipt was very easy! Ramen comes in disposable bowls and drinks have sippy cup lids, so no need for a straw!"
Kamado Ramen,4,Lunch on a Wednesday1110am20 minute wait to get awesome Asian spaghetti Mistakes were madeMistakes were fixed in a timely mannerBest bowl of ramen for many many milesTasty like KoreaYumtastic!!!
Kamado Ramen,4,"Short: welcome addition with good food. Definitely the best ramen option in town.Longer: Went for lunch during its first week. They are still very busy, but so are most good ramen places wherever you go. Tried the pork (tonkatsu) and spicy pork ramens ansld the kara-age. The two broths are rich but well flavored and not overly salted. I enjoyed it and will be back. But I want to try some of the other options to see if they are lighter.My only qualm is with the noodles. I get that there are many different types of noodles used in ramen, and I'm open to all styles, but I prefer ones that are slightly thicker, slightly chewier, and with kinks. These were just a little underwhelming. But again, I'm going back for sure.The kara-age (Japanese fried chicken bites) were amazing. I could eat these over rice for a meal and be happy. So, so good. Looking forward to trying the takoyaki next!!"
Kamado Ramen,5,"I love ramen, I have eaten ramen all my life throughout my childhood.  The meal here was really good and filling.  I had the chicken ramen meal with a pork bun and a soda.  The only complaint I had was the price seemed slightly high for what I ordered.  All I had cost me $22.24.  The food was so good I may come back when I am having a ramen fit."
Kamado Ramen,4,This was my husband and I's first time trying Kamado Ramen. We came in during lunch time and didn't wait more than 10 minutes. The decor and paintings on the wall in this cute little shop were pleasing to the eye. We both ordered takoyaki and the chicken ramen. The broth was full of flavor and really took up the other flavors in the soup very well. The only thing I didn't like was the mushrooms and swirly fish cake but that is a personal preference. It was delicious overall and I really enjoyed the atmosphere and friendly service!
Kamado Ramen,3,"Kamado Ramen opened to much fanfare (see all the reviews about the wait time) and is a good addition to the Huntsville food scene. Ultimately though, in comparing it to other Ramens I have had throughout the US, this ramen comes up short. The flavor of the broth is solid, but the meat was definitely lacking flavor. Additionally, the other toppings aside from the meat were unremarkable, which is disappointing because other ramen's I have had have wonderful additions to make a complete dish. Also, I feel all ramen should be with egg noodles, and in Kamado's case, they have egg noodles and flour noodles. Personal preference, but I feel the egg noodles are much more suited to soup. Overall, I am glad they opened, and I am glad they are opening folks palates to something different and a new experience."
Kamado Ramen,5,"The wait time is a little long since it just opened, but the staff are very friendly and the food is delicious! You can watch them make the pork broth right in front of you. I'm so glad this place opened! Definitely try the tonkotsu ramen."
Super Chix,4,"Super Chix was catered to my job this past week and I enjoyed it. So I wanted to give it another try. Today I got a fried buffalo chicken with an order of fries. It was very good. I love a good buffalo chicken sandwich. I was pleased with my order, the freshness of the meal. I will definitely order again. I got the curb side service which was a plus and my order came out quick."
Super Chix,5,"This is a great chicken sandwich! I describe it to people as the Five Guys of Chicken sandwiches. Very juicy and tender piece of chicken, nicely seasoned and battered, and fried to perfection. The fries are not my favorite, but they are still very good. I'm just saying they aren't the best fries I've ever had, but still great tasting fries with superb texture. Will have to come back next time I'm in the area to try the custard."
Super Chix,3,"I really agonized over three or four stars, I wish I could go three and a half. The restaurant is of the new school of fast food; you enter the serpentine as soon as you enter the restaurant and choose from a menu on three giant televisions mounted in portrait mode, then place your order. There's no sound abatement at all, concrete floor, metal chairs, lots of glass. That means a lot of ambient noise making conversation difficult.As for the food, there's only so much you can do with chicken - grilled or fried. My brother opted for grilled and I choose fried. I found the breading to be tasty but both our selections seemed a little dry and tough to chew.Super Chix specializes in frozen custard. Being from Milwaukee, where frozen custard is more a religious experience than a menu item, we're kinda fussy. We both ordered shakes, mint for him and strawberry for me. Shakes were smooth and flavorful but the frozen custard was riddled with ice crystals.From what I understand, they do great French Fries. Before I go home, I'd like to give Super Chix another chance. I think I'll just order fries and a shake next time, and see if the ice crystals in the frozen custard last time was just a fluke."
Super Chix,4,"While visiting town after running the rocket city marathon, I visited here for a nice afternoon bite while trying to regain my leg strength. I saw this was a new restaurant and thought it would be great to try. There are so many options for chicken, and each one looks and smells delicious!I ended up trying the fried tenders Nashville style and having the side of Cajun fries. I was very happy with the amount of flavor and spiciness both delivered. Someone at my table got fried pickles to try; they were good, but we preferred them to be a little thinner and more breading. Overall, a great experience that should offer all poultry fans something to enjoy. I can't wait until the one in Hoover opens so I can frequent there when I'm in the mood!"
Super Chix,5,"Had the buffalo chicken sandwich fries during my visit. First of all it was amazing. The chicken  was  fresh and delicious. It is a little ""tight"" space wise due to the large crowd, but for sure worth it. P.S. These visits were b.c. (Before Corona)"
Super Chix,5,"I'm excited about this new restaurant.  I walked in last week and they are in the final stages to their grand opening.  I look forward to the chicken sandwiches, hand-spun shakes, and custard.  I'll update my review after they open.10/09/19 Update: They opened last Friday and I was able to visit today for lunch. I arrived early to beat the crowd and that was a smart move as the restaurant filled up quickly. I ordered three fried chicken fingers and cajun fries. The food came to the table after a little wait; the wait wasn't quick and it wasn't slow. The food was very hot and obviously just came from the fryer. The chicken tenders were fat, juicy, and very fresh. The fries were plentiful and had the perfect amount of cajun seasoning. The restaurant offers 7 different sauces. I tried the honey mustard and Super Chix Signature Sauce. I liked the Signature Sauce the best.  I'm not sure what is in it, but it was very good. My ticket for the tenders, fries, and a drink was $11.23 before tip."
Super Chix,4,"We'd been excitedly waiting for the opening busyness to calm down, as we were SO excited to try out Super Chix.  I love fried chicken, and there's been nowhere to get custard in Huntsville after Frizzle's closed several years ago, so needless to say...this place is a big deal for me!Super Chix is a little smaller on the inside than it looks on the outside, but it's nicely decorated, modern, and very clean.  There's a little bit of patio seating, which is nice.  We were really impressed with the service, and one gentleman in particular, who offered to bus our tables for us and came up to us and asked us how we were enjoying our meals.  One other cool thing is there's a sauce bar, where you can try as many signature sauces as you want with your chicken.  I tried the buffalo, the ranch, and the signature special sauce.  I liked the ranch best, then buffalo.  Didn't love the special sauce, but no worries.Unfortunately, we weren't especially wowed by the food.  I wouldn't go so far as to call it disappointing, but maybe a little underwhelmed.  I had fried chicken tenders, boyfriend got the special Korean barbecue sandwich, and we split a large fry.  The fries were pretty good, although our serving had a lot of very tiny fry pieces and not enough full size fries.  They were salted well, and were nice and crunchy, but if I visit again, I'll definitely try the cajun or loaded variation, as they just had a sort of bland quality to them.  The chicken sandwich was decent, but slightly over-sauced, and apparently there were parts of the sandwich that were over-breaded.  The tenders were the main not-so-great sticking point, though.  Although the meat was really juicy and succulent, I thought the breading was on the sweet side (I like my breading more peppery).  My main complaint, though, is that they were reaaaally greasy.  So greasy that when I picked them up, my fingers were left coated and dripping in grease.  And after a few minutes, the tenders were soggy from it.  I did still eat them, and I do believe there's potential; I think I would've liked them if they just hadn't been as greasy.On the bright side, we tried the custard of the week, cookies and cream, and it was AWESOME!  Absolutely loaded with cookie pieces, thick, dense, and creamy, I was really impressed with it.  I'll absolutely be back for more custard.  I'll likely also try the chicken again, and will absolutely update my review if I enjoy it more.  I really really really want to love this place, as I love the concept and the service was great.Update:  the owner reached out to me to talk about my first visit.  I was on the fence about a 3 or 4 star rating to begin with (seriously - the custard and service were both AMAZING), but his professionalism and desire to make my experience right meant so much, so I'm updating to a 4.  Looking forward to trying some tenders again soon!"
Super Chix,4,The Korean BBQ is a very tender spice full sandwich. I believe the slaw may over power the Korean sauce though. The fries were nice and hot. The service is on point and very quick to help with anything that we may have overlooked. Great place to meet with your friends or family.  Will definitely be back. Thanks again.
Super Chix,3,"I ordered the crispy avocado sandwich. From the description online, it looks like a crispy chicken sandwich with avocado on it. It's actually a tiny breaded avocado with weird garlic mayo. Interesting, but not what I expected. I'll try something else next time!"
Super Chix,5,"Atmosphere: A+Service: A+Food Quality: A++++Hands down WAY better than Chic Fil A!! I have eaten here for the last 3 days. The deluxe sandwich is my go to. The rosemary pepper fries are out of this world. I have also tried their custard. The Butterfinger custard is out of this world!! I will definitely be back. Keep up the great work, this was just what Huntsville needed!"
Super Chix,4,"Update: We have stopped in twice since the our original review. We have left twice as well. There is nothing more stressful than the thought of standing in a corner with trays full of food and not having an open table in sight. The real downfall of this establishment is the seating. You order your food at the counter and then head out with a number and drink cups in hand and try to find a table. I decided to give Super Chix a try after 9 rounds of a verbal boxing match about ""what are we going to cook"".  We went round and round trying to figure it out. I grabbed the keys and loaded everyone up and headed out. It was a bit busy, but that's expected here in HSV with anything newish. Our orders consisted of the chx fingers, cheesy bbq, buffalo ranch and the simple sandwich. I gotta say we were all impressed with the food quality and taste. My cheesy bbq chx was very good, loaded with cheddar cheese, fried onion rings and a bbq sauce. I got the Cajun fries and they were very reminiscent of the 5 guys seasoning, which is an awesome thing. We finished off our dinner with some frozen custard. The cookies and cream was the flavor of the week and it was delicious. All in all everyone was happy with our first visit and have agreed to go back soon and try some other sandwiches and maybe some fried pickles. Oh and the have a sauce station with some awesome ranch, they had many others but I'm from the south and can dip anything in ranch."
Super Chix,5,"Amazing ! Now the conversation of the year was if Popeyes chicken sandwhich better than Chick-fil-A's,well now this place is in town they have blown out the competition. Not only is the food great, plus they have great and speedy service unlike the other new restaurants in town. My husband tried the Nashville hot sandwhich and I tried the Korean BBQ sandwhich, we also ordered a large fry (a regular sized fry would've been just fine for the two of us) and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The sandwiches had great flavor and I can't wait to go back to try the salad."
Super Chix,5,Verrrry Good Grilled Cajun Chkn Sandwiches!!!!I reccommend the Cajun Grilled + Gouda with cajun fries.Get there before 11am if youre gonna have lunch. Dessert available.$10 saladsAvg meal price $13ish
Super Chix,5,"If someone asked me to describe Super Chix to them, I would describe it as a Chick-fil-a/Five Guys mashup with better sauce. I ordered the Simple Fried Chicken sandwich with a side of Rosemary Pepper fries. My sandwich was INCREDIBLE, so I have since gone back to the restaurant several more times. The piece of fried chicken that was placed upon my delicious sandwich bun was HUGE, but I did not struggle to finish it because of how great it tasted. The rosemary pepper fries were also top notch, although now that I have gone to the restaurant a few more times, I know that the Regular Salt with cheese fries are my staple.Super Chix also offers an unlimited sauce bar that has a wide variety of sauces! I enjoyed their Signature Sauce the best, but also loved their unique Nashville Hot that certainly had a kick to it. Of course I could not leave the restaurant without having tried one of their famous custards, so once I finished devouring my chicken sandwich, I still somehow had room for the Mint Custard milkshake. I enjoyed it, but I think next time I would order the Mint Oreo custard because the shake seemed to be lacking something I can't quite put my finger on.Overall, I am so extremely happy with Super Chix. It is affordable, delicious, and exciting to finally have a decent fried chicken sandwich place that isn't a fast food drive-thru line train wreck like you so often see at our once, but no longer, favorite fried chicken spot, Chick-fil-a."
Super Chix,3,"Nothing really stood out. They have a good selection of sauces for their tenders. The tenders were moist and juicy. The breading was dark, maybe cooked too long or oil is needing to be changed. I ordered the loaded fries with cajun seasoning, but did not taste it. They put the fries in a boat and I guess if it's a large they over flow it. The problem it that they put all the toppings on the fries that were in the boat, so the overflow had next to nothing. Ordered a mini custard and the flavor was good but not worth $3.50. Never a fan of an À la cart menu. $27 just for my wife and I. A large loaded fry is not worth 6.50.  I was not wowed. I tried it, but nothing is saying man I need to go back or you need to try this. Also it took 10 minutes to get our order and they weren't that busy."
Super Chix,5,Wanted to try something new. My husband loved it! He said he prefers their chicken sandwich over Chick-fil-a which is huge for him because he could live off of them! Perfect amount of crispy! It was packed and I had to wait for everyone to get done eating and move and seemed like people were racing to tables to ask if they were leaving to claim the table. That's my only complaint. We will be back!
Super Chix,4,"We got it to go so disclaimer! Lol it's was good!!! If you get the fries get them with Cajun seasoning- reminds me of five guys Cajun fries. Sooooo good! But the chicken sandwiches are kinda basic. Well not basic but nothing fancy. Still very good though! They have several sauces and the option for breaded and grilled, so you can customize your sandwich to your liking. High recommend if you want a break from Chick-fil-A and Zaxbys."
Super Chix,2,Ordered a salad the house with chicken to be exact. Arcadian greens here means Romaine middles and iceberg. No bacon and very small for 10$ on the positive the dressing was very good although not the honey mustard I ordered and the chicken was good.
Super Chix,5,"Sooo good! Super quick service and food was delicious, very tasty and good portions. We had Cheesy BBQ sandwiches, loaded Cajun fries and fried pickles, loved the dipping sauces available too. Nice outdoor patio. Would highly recommend!"
Super Chix,3,"Just opened today and service was fine. Food was good but I give them a 3 star because a sandwich, drink and fries is almost $14 per person. I think it's high. My chicken sandwich was over sauces that made it over powering and sloppy. Fries were real good. Next time I might order fingers."
Walton’s Southern Table,5,"One of my favorites! Service can sometimes be a little slow, but the food is great! Some of the sides are different than traditional way of cooking, but I've never been disappointed."
Walton’s Southern Table,4,"Delicious!!!   We tried several options today.  Fried chicken was good, loved the greens, the hash brown casserole is to die for!  Mashed potatoes with white gravy was sooo good, the fried green tomatoes were a little salty but good, the hush puppies were pretty pepper but really good.   Overall delicious and looking forward to trying other things.  The staff was nice, food prepared and delivered to car promptly after calling in order from parking lot.     Everything was in order.  Good experience!"
Walton’s Southern Table,1,"First time eating their food.  Got the curb-side pickup.The fried green tomatoes were paper thin and very crispy much like potato chips.  Basically, some batter with a slight hint of tomato taste.  The okra was nothing special and basically the same stuff as you get in the frozen section of the supermarket.  I looked at the Chicken and Dumplings and it looked too much like Sweet Sue canned variety.  I threw them out."
Walton’s Southern Table,4,"(3.5 stars) I don't usually eat in southern-style restaurants, but my friend wanted some fried okra. The menu was pretty typical (lots of sides like Mac n cheese, green beans, mashed potatoes, etc; fried catfish, fried chicken, baked chicken, meatloaf, etc). We started with the fried green tomatoes & dip appetizer and house salads. The waiter (he was so sweet!) told us the tomatoes were a bit spicy and salty to make sure that's what we really wanted; I appreciated that! We still got em, of course, and he was right; they were salty. They were also thin and crispy, though, and the dip was good. I had a few before my tongue told me to stop. The house salad was nice: tomato, red onion, cucumber, cheese and housemade croutons. Good portion for a salad right before the main course. Bleu cheese dressing never lets me down. I ordered baked ¼ chicken (dark meat) with mashed potatoes, turnip greens and shoe peg corn.  The chicken was juicy, the greens were packed with flavor and the corn was sweet. The yeast roll was quite nice and the corn bread was a bit dry but still good. I really enjoyed my meal. The customer device was full of smiles and we talked to the older couple in the booth across from us the entire meal. Pleasant company, pleasant food, and great prices! Southern-style indeed."
Walton’s Southern Table,5,Our first time here! Loved it! Our food came out very quickly and our waitress was very nice and continued to check on us. Everything was well cooked and yummy! We'll be back!
Walton’s Southern Table,4,"This is my wife and I's second visit. They were not busy and we were seated immediately. Our waitress was great -- no issues what so ever with service or any of the staff.  I got almost the same things -- fried catfish, fried green tomatoes, fried okra & sweet potato casserole. The catfish was, once again, spot on. I loved it. The sweet potato casserole was also really good. The fried okra wasn't like homemade but it was much better than the standard fried okra you get at most restaurants. Short of homemade this would be my next choice when it comes to okra -- so great job here. As with my previous review the fried green tomatoes -- I was so hoping the first time was an anomaly. However, this is the way they prepare it. I actually spoke to our waitress and she said it was of there  ""signature dish"". I was heartbroken to hear that lol. Honestly, I've really loved everything so far and thought I had found a home :). Bottom line -- so far everything had been really good except the fried green tomatoes. However, you should try them. My wife got a salad. I am sorry but don't remember which one but she felt like it was old. She said it tasted like it was one of those they make in the morning and serve during the course of the day. Again, my recommendation hasn't changed. This is becoming my go to place and with some public pressure we can get the fried green tomatoes we want....lol I'm just kidding. However, this is a solid place to eat and you will not feel cheated when you leave."
Walton’s Southern Table,4,"Really enjoyed the fried chicken.. tender, moist, cooked well.Service was very friendly, even though they were completely packed, with some large (club) groups.  Sides were alright.  They have a short beer list with some local options.Not a light meal, but you knew that going in."
Walton’s Southern Table,5,"Good food, good service and consistent.Every time I come to Huntsville we order takeout."
Walton’s Southern Table,5,"Second time I go there. As southern cuisine, a lot of the dishes are fried (which I really avoid as much as possible), but they have a few dishes actually not fried and are pretty delicious. Their sides are really good and tasty, and I like both of their rolls. I have not tried their desserts yet but I'm sure it is good. Servers are so nice and the food is actually pretty cheap for all you get. Will go back"
Walton’s Southern Table,5,"Love it! Love it!Had the chicken w/dressing & 3 sides.Was in heaven. Service is clean & super fast.Prices cant be beat. Did have lemon pie, but got to go.Cant wait to go back!"
Walton’s Southern Table,5,"Ugh. If I could transform into a piece of Walton's pot roast I would eat a piece of myself every single day. And just savor it. And the chocolate pie. And the fried green tomatos--ARE SO CRISP! How do you make it so good?! If you haven't tried Walton's yet and you are a southern food fan, you must try it. 100% reccomend"
Walton’s Southern Table,5,Some of the best southern food I had.    the fried green tomatoes were perfectly done with some nice spice to them.   Chicken & dressing was also flavorful.   Highly recommend!
Walton’s Southern Table,5,"Great food and service. The food came quickly. Our drinks stayed filled without asking. Everything was delicious. According to my kids, macaroni and cheese was off the charts. It looked like a fine dining restaurant, but the food was very affordable."
Walton’s Southern Table,3,"This place is good but not outstanding. Atmosphere was quaint but it gives me retirement home vibes. Some other reviews said hospital and I can see it. The service was excellent. Glenn was attentive and helpful with the meal selection. The menu was amazing and I found it hard to pick what to eat because it all looked good. Ended up with the pot roast with green beans and hash brown casserole. The sides were great including the roll. The pot roast was disappointing (not enough meat). My friend wasn't terribly impressed with his salmon croquettes. Overall, not bad especially with the affordable prices. But I live across town and it's not worth a special drive to eat there."
Walton’s Southern Table,4,"Walton's Southern Table is not a health food restaurant. Anyone coming here to eat barely cooked vegetables and to eat a quinoa and arugula salad will be disappointed.Walton's Southern Table is more akin to a Cracker Barrel Restaurant. The emphasis is on comfort food cooked Southern style.The meat loaf I ate here recently was very good. In another meal, I went for the fried catfish with mashed potatoes and squash.The yeast rolls were excellent. The iced tea is genuine Southern iced tea. The squash was thoroughly cooked and sauteed. The potato was good, but a little too salty, and the catfish was lightly fried and tasted great.For those with a hankering for traditional Southern food, often derided in the press from other parts of the country, the okra and fried green tomatoes are reportedly good although the tomatoes had too much flour covering the tomatoes. On the other hand, there are not a large number of restaurants with either of these items on the menu so the competition for those with an appetite for these tidbits is quite small.Our waiter, Trent, was very forthcoming, friendly and made sure our food was delivered correctly and that we were happy. The open friendly nature of the restaurant personnel was a pleasant change from the more reserved and formal nature of the restaurants in California where I had recently visited. Trent made it obvious we were back in the American South but with the homespun style and the menu options.All of us dining on this occasion liked the restaurant and intend to go back again."
Walton’s Southern Table,5,"So, my husband and I took a quick summer trip to Huntsville and usually when we travel, we try to go to unique local places.  I saw that some of the reviews for here were mixed- looking back at our meal, I am shocked to see that. I had the chicken and dressing (moist, flavorful) with mashed potatoes and strawberry pretzel salad (my fav!  I never make it because my hubby won't eat it)  the cranberry sauce was a nice touch.  Hubby had the roast beef, sweet potatoes, cabbage, and greens- he loved his.My picky toddler had the mac n cheese.  I was shocked at two things- 1.  How large the serving was!  And 2. My picky toddler actually ate it!  He kept saying ""yummmm"" and ate a surprising amount for him.  I also have to mention our waiter ( I think his name was Sam??? I'm awful with names).  He was kind without being pushy.  Made sure we had everything we needed, and I overheard another table ask about the gluten free menu and he went to the kitchen and wrote everything they could make.  He took his time with them and made sure they were able to get a meal appropriate for their needs.  The only strange thing of the night was one of the light bulbs busted while we were finishing up and glass shattered.  It was a little scary!  The guy busing the tables was there and he didn't even bat an eye (or ask if we were ok or try to clean up the glass).  I told our waiter about it and he went to get a broom to clean it up right away.  The bathrooms and restaurant were clean, the menu was unique- This is a must try if you are in the area!"
Walton’s Southern Table,1,Just a high dollar Cracker Barrel if you ask me. The fried chicken is so big the breading just falls off and you end up with a thick hunk of chicken with no flavor. The sides taste of rosemary. If you don't like rosemary in any of your sides then like me you will be disappointed.
Walton’s Southern Table,5,"Stopped by on our way home from our Florida vacation. It was so worth the 20 min drive out of our way. The food was amazing and the staff superior above all others. Nia was wonderful. Very very very friendly and had a constant smile when addressing our table.  If you find yourself in Huntsville Alabama, check this place out. You will not be disappointed."
Walton’s Southern Table,3,The service was okay. Our waiter only came to the table once to get us more water. The Chicken and Fried Green Tomatoes were refried and not fresh. I asked for some fresh ones and got the same refried Tomatoes. The spinach was delish and the Mac & Cheese was a kraft box. I wasn't impressed at all.
Walton’s Southern Table,4,"Reasonably priced. Great service. The chicken and stuffing was good. Mashed potatoes were average. I would have skipped them. Corn bread and Mac and cheese were amazing!  Portion sizes are big. If you leave hungry, that's your fault."
West End Grill,5,"My friends and I came to the West End Grill around the timeframe of 5:30-6pm. My friends have been to WEG numerous times in the past, but this was first time. All I got to say about my first time at WEG is that: 1) Greeted very nice and was seated quickly 2) our waiter knew his stuff and made sure if we needed more drinks and other things and 3) my food was absolutely delicious. I got the Southern Chicken Fried Platter (chicken breast) and I'll definitely get it again! First time being at WEG and I'll be here again for sure in the near future!"
West End Grill,3,"Here is Huntsville for training abs the group decided on West End Grill for lunch. Nothing too special about this place. Ordered a turkey and Swiss sandwich with sweet potato fries. Nothing to rave about. Tasted good, service was okay."
West End Grill,5,"Homemade, delicious food and great service! We love finding the places the locals go and this find did not disappoint. We stopped in for a late lunch after hanging out at the botanical gardens, with kids in tow. There was something for everyone, my hubby loved the French dip and my stepson had his first club sandwich! The manager/owner was so attentive and came by several times to check on us, and even brought my fussy toddler a roll to make her happy! That stuff goes a long way with me! GET THE TOT ROAST!! We shared the small as an appetizer.... out of this world good!!"
West End Grill,5,I stopped by this place after work one day and I really didn't know what to expect. I looked at the menu and couldn't decide what to order everything sounded good. So I decided on the roast beef sandwich with the au jus on the side. The moment I dipped that sandwich and took a bite out of it my mind was blown. The flavor was amazing. I'm willing to travel to this place just for that sandwich.
West End Grill,5,Staying across the street at the Candlewood Suites and decided to try this place it's plenty lively so far.  The waitress is nice and my beer is ice cold. Ok ate my food steak was cooked better than Logan's char was perfect! This place rocks ! Maggie rocks!
West End Grill,3,"Arriving from a late flight into Huntsville, my team chose West End Grill due to it's proximity to our hotel and long hours. Since it was already late in the evening, I went only with a fried chicken salad but we got pot roast tots which really channeled Huntsville/Southern poutine, for the table to share and everyone else got burgers and sandwiches for their meal.The service was fine though a bit slow for the amount of folks in the restaurant. All that aside, the food was fine. I thought the pot roast tots were a bit too salty and it's quite the heavy dish. But that's what you know you're getting yourself into! My fried chicken salad was fine and everyone else enjoyed their sandwich. All in all, West End Grill fit the bill and fed me for the evening in large portions. Should we need another late getaway for food in Huntsville, we'll probably stop by again!"
West End Grill,3,"Came by while visiting UAH. We were seated quickly as it was not very busy on a week night. We ordered BBQ wings (a little dry and small), pot roast tater tots (good but a bit salty), veggie plate with collards, tater tots, green beans and Cole slaw ( could not eat collards too much salt, all others were ok), steak with sweet potato fries and rice ( steak was ok not great)  Our waiter was pretty attentive with drinks. Pricing is average. Will continue trying restaurants in the area."
West End Grill,4,We loved this place! Zack's Tot Roast is absolutely terrific! Don't know how they make the pot roast but its perfect... we ordered the small as an appetizer... next time will have it for my entree... the steak tips were perfectly cooked and tender... the fries were crisp and tasty... husband's chicken fried steak was crispy and the green beans were cooked the way we like them... southern style... not crisp... we had the bread pudding with pecans and ice cream... now for the only reason I did not give 5 stars... the mac and cheese was dry and not at all creamy... and the pecans on the bread pudding were burnt making them bitter... but the good was sooo good that it well made up for the not so good
West End Grill,5,"We both had homemade chili, salad & beer. The ""cup of soup was served in a coffee cup, which was cute! The food was delicious. Our waitress made local beer recommendations (& allowed us to sample a few) which was wonderful as passers-by! The camaraderie of the staff makes for an efficient, clean, friendly environment.The only bummer was not seeing the 10% off your bill Yelp coupon available with check-in."
West End Grill,4,"Definitely a local bar as nearly everyone in there seemed to know everyone else. Had a good vibe to it but as soon as the 4-7 football game was over, 1/2 the place cleared out. Drinks are reasonably priced and a good variety.  My ribeye steak was one of the best I've ever had and I would definitely go back here again."
West End Grill,4,"Pretty nice place. Went there a couple of times. Food was good but nothing too fancy. A few dishes are frozen tho. Lot of southern variety and good sides. Servers were all nice, only had to wait a very long time for food once whereas the restaurant was almost empty. I will go back once in awhile for sure"
West End Grill,5,"This place is great. So we went here on a business trip to Huntsville. We walk in and it's clean clean! We sit down and the waitress recommends the Zach tot roast... phenomenal! She is explaining it and Zach himself comes over. He says if you don't like it, I'll buy it. We got it... we loved it... this place is great and Zach is awesome. Great folks!!!"
West End Grill,4,"What you want a late night bite? Well then you're in luck cause this is the spot! It ain't no Waffle House that's for sure! The food smacks of homemade and the bar is kick'n late night. Make sure to get the tater tots covered with their pot roast and gravy...it may sound odd but that Pot Roast is is Killer! It's so good and hard to believe that you can get something that tasty at 11pm. The burger is also good but my guess is they have allot of good dishes on the menu, I'd eat here again."
West End Grill,4,"I do like this place. Nice local bar and grill. However, I'm not a fan of their Steaks. Apparently, they've gone with a new brand and both my wife's ny strip and my Ribeye were rubbery. I'd stick with the other items which are quite tasty. If you want a great steak, go to a steakhouse."
West End Grill,4,Family had a very nice meal at West End Grill.  We started with the fried crawfish tails which were really good.  We then had a couple different burgers that were cooked perfectly and our daughter loved the options on the kids menu from which she ordered the corn dog.  West End has a very nice beer selection including several local beers on tap.
West End Grill,5,West End Grill hands down is the hidden gem of Huntsville. You will never get a bad meal here! We live close by and come often. Sunday brunch here is really good. The crab cake Benedict is my favorite and they have THE BEST Bloody Mary bar. I recommend this place to everyone!
West End Grill,3,"We were looking for a place to eat after Church today and this showed up on my phone. My friend who was in our group said she had been here a few times and really liked the meatloaf and the pot roast. My husband started with the chili. He normally eats everything, but didn't finish his Chile because it had no flavor.  I tried it and agreed. On other friend and I got the pot roast. We both felt a little off when we were eating. I think it was the gravy. It tasted like it was out of a jar--I guess, I have never ate gravy out of a jar except in school 30 years ago, but I didn't really like it and like I said, I wasn't feeling that great while I was eating it and my friend said it gave her a stomach ache. The staff was nice and good service. The place was very busy. I just didn't like my meal. Others seemed to like theirs."
West End Grill,4,"I was visiting Huntsville this weekend for the AHSAA Wrestling State Championships at the Von Braun Center. I asked for suggestions on reddit for places to eat in the limited time we had in the city. West End Grill was suggested by several people, so we made our way there for lunch on Friday(2/15/19). It was myself(dad, 41), my oldest son(17, wrestling competitor), my youngest son(4), and my mother(let's just say 60+).For apps, we had the honey bbq wings. Very well cooked. Juicy and tender, but still had a crispy skin, and while the sauce was nothing exceptional, we ate every wing. I myself prefer a spicier wing sauce, but with a toddler and senior, we opted for something flavorful but not spicy. We also had the fried mushrooms. Very very delicious. The batter was crispy, the mushrooms weren't soggy at all, and the horseradish sauce that came with them was a perfect compliment. My mother and I consider ourselves fried mushroom aficionados, and these were top notch.For entrees, my mother had the club, which she devoured. Plenty of ham, turkey, and bacon.My older son had The Wegulator burger, and made it a double. He destroyed half of it before having to unbuckle his belt. He ate the other half back at the hotel with no complaints other than, ""OMG, it's just so much food.""I had the French Dip, which was delicious. I added some raw onion (because I'm an onion freak) and a bit of their horseradish spread. The au jus was deliciously rich and I couldn't get enough. The tots I had as a side were crispy and a welcome accompaniment. My only complaint would be that the roast beef was sliced VERY thickly, which made it a little chewy. It was a little hard to eat without pulling out large chunks of beef with every bite. The flavors, however, were completely en pointe, and I would certainly order it again.The four year old had a corndog, which was just a typical frozen dog, deep fried. He didn't eat much because he had a bit of a stomach ache, so I can't blame the restaurant for that at all. I tasted the corndog and while it was nothing special, it was fried just right. Crunchy exterior with a juicy dog inside. Can't ask for much more when it comes to a kid's meal corndog.All in all, the next time I find myself in Huntsville, I will certainly make it a point to revisit West End Grill."
West End Grill,4,"Ok so, this place is very interesting. The interior is nice. The fish tanks  are really cool. The mixed drinks aren't that great which is why I gave 4 stars. The food is phenomenal though. The burger was amazing and so were the frys. Better than anything I expected from this place and we will definitely be back."
West End Grill,4,"Picked this place from Yelp, and wasn't disappointed. The Burger was good, bread pudding was fantastic. Had to order another after tasting it."
The Brass Tap,5,"I have been to The Brass Tap several times before for lunch and dinner and have always enjoyed the food (wings, Korean pork bbq, burger especially) and service.  I'm not much of a beer drinker, but their huge selection has inspired me to try a few that I haven't seen anywhere else and I've really enjoyed them.  Great liquor selection, too, with my favorite super-unique and hard to find Gin!  It was a no-brainer when I was tasked with putting together a party for my company's party and Kurt, Harold and Chris really worked with me to make it a fun, memorable night for all of us!  They worked with our budget and kept  the hot food buffet filled with great food, and the servers did an amazing job making sure everyone had what  they needed with cheerful smiles on their faces the entIre night!  They even arranged live entertainment for us on a night there was none scheduled.  They made everything so easy, so  smooth and so enjoyable for our group - everyone was still talking about it for days!"
The Brass Tap,4,"I was in town for work and wanted somewhere to watch the Kentucky basketball game. This place literally has tvs on every wall. To my happy surprise, they have an amazing happy hour. You can literally eat and drink off that menu and not even open the actual menu. The Boom Boom shrimp is good and the portion was pretty large with large shrimp. I also got the steak nachos. Once again, large portions and great flavor. Additionally, there's a parking garage around back."
The Brass Tap,3,"My monthly Girl's Night Out converged her in July as a first time visit for all who attended, I think there were 6 of us. We sat at one of the larger hightop 'farm style"" tables directly in front of the bar. [pro tip: parking on the east side of the restaurant (which is the back) is free and I think, 2 story, it's at least one story and covered with is nice in this blazing heat.]It was happy hour  - I think I got there right after 4 PM. The place is pretty noisy and does offer east side and north side patios. It was just too hot to sit outside. I don't drink beer, so I can't comment on their beer selection or value except to say that some of my group had beers and seemed pleased with the selections and pricing. Their house wine is Canyon Road which is not offered in a pinot grigio. I'm pretty sure I opted for a Kendall Jackson pinot grigio followed by a less expensive Cavit pg.Trying to eat healthy, I was curious what the difference was in the HH brussels sprouts and the side of brussels sprouts, at any rate, I'm not sure which I got, but they tasted fine. I was not a big fan of the roasted peppers that are pretty much ubiquitous at TBT, but it was not that big of a love loss to have them present. I also ordered a house salad with a chicken add on (which also comes with the roasted peppers in the salad). The chicken was weird. I am not sure what I was expecting but I do know this chicken seemed more like a cold cut variety, I think, because of the way it was cut (see picture.) Also, it did not have much flavor. One in our group had their version of Bonefish's Boom Boom shrimp and it was pretty presentation-wise and she seemed to really like it.For being primarily a beer joint, TBT does an okay job of satisfying the wine-drinking healthier eating folks. The staff were really helpful and on point with their service."
The Brass Tap,4,"(4.5 stars; not 5 only because I've only been there once so i don't know if they're consistently this good)I came in with a group of 4 around 10:30pm on a Sunday evening. I hadn't ever heard of The Brass Tap but they were the only place open other than fast food, so of course we wanted to try it.It was pretty empty (again, 10:30pm on a Sunday night) and was still fairly new--about 3 weeks old. Since it's so new, I'm sure that's why they were still on their best behavior, but my hope is they remain this good as they gain popularity because it was really a great experience.Here's what we ordered: the impossible burger, the kogi dog, boom boom shrimp, Brussels sprouts, and the five cheese flat bread with chicken and bbq sauce added.First, the side house salad was shockingly large, simple, and delicious. Just spring mix greens, cheese and roasted red pepper. No traditional toppings that usually come on a house salad (tomato, cucumber, red onion, bacon, etc.). It was a really good salad and refreshing. It went well with the kogi dog, which had cole slaw and pickled onion on it. I had to cut it in half to eat it since it came on a toasted (but not too toasted!) sub roll. There was also a sweet soy sauce-y sauce on the dog that seeped into the bread, but didn't make it soggy (good bread). My meal was great!My friend ordered the impossible burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles and pickled onion. There was no mayo on the burger, and it didnt need it! It dawned on her after she ate the burger that there was no mayo. Very unusual, but that's how good the burger was. She was disappointed there were no onion rings on the menu, but her fries were good.Another friend ordered the boom boom shrimp and the Brussels sprouts. The sprouts weren't overcooked or doused in unnecessary sauces. They were still a nice green color and had a bite to them (in terms of texture, not spice) and were quite tasty. (Why didn't anyone ever make them like this when I was a kid? Boiled Brussels are for suckers.) She enjoyed her boom boom shrimp, too. Huge pieces of shrimp in a metallic martini glass. They were sauce-y but also crunchy. Great flavor, great amount of spice.Lastly, my other friend ordered the five cheese flatbread and added chicken and bbq sauce. They weren't stingy with the chicken at all--it really covered the whole flatbread. The bread was nice and thin but not goopey or gooey; it held the toppings well and he said it was really good. The bbq sauce had a little kick to it as well (he took some to-go).The meal was great, honestly. I'm not in the habit of giving 5 stars to places I've only been once so I'm going with 4 here (since I can't give 4.5). I'm definitely going to go back, though, and my hope is that they continue with the great service (Hank was amazing!) and food. I feel a 5-star updated rating coming around the corner!"
The Brass Tap,5,"The Brass Tap is a great sports bar and addition to the south memorial parkway mix of new restaurants and shopping. I came here for a happy hour with some buddies about a week after they opened up. I should have taken some pictures but can probably still speak to some of their specials.Even though they were just new to open, you could tell they were doing their best to keep orders coming on time and service quickly available to each table. Our waitress was always swing by despite the growing crowd.The interior / exterior was pretty spacious: garage doors that opened to a patio, plenty of TVs on the inside and a pretty loaded bar. They also had a great selection of draft / craft beers.As for their food and drink deals - they have $4 happy hour drafts (mostly local beers) and $4-7 meals, like flatbreads, burgers and tacos. All seemed to be pretty good in terms of value. I'm not sure how happy hour goes until, but I'll be sure to coming back again in the near future."
The Brass Tap,4,"Visited last week for a girls' lunch with my mom.  We wound up only splitting a poutine appetizer, as neither of us were super hungry, but we enjoyed our visit.I'd describe The Brass Tap as...I dunno, a slightly more modern, upscale Applebee's?  The menu consists mostly of appetizers and bar food, but the options are fairly unique and done well.  Seating leaves a little to be desired if you don't like those high up tables and stool type chairs; there are only a few normal, four person tables in the place.  However, the restaurant was very clean and roomy; I imagine a lot of people could hang out here if it got packed.  Looks like they do a lot of fun stuff during the evenings (trivia, bar games, etc), so that probably warrants another visit.Service was friendly, cracked some jokes, and was extremely diligent about keeping our Cokes refilled.  Our poutine was like traditional poutine -- with crinkle cut fries, fried cheese curds, gravy, and scallions on top.  The fries were maybe just a little too salty, but they were hot, fresh, and stood up to the gravy well.  The gravy had good flavor, but was maybe a little on the viscous side, too.  A good dish, not perfect, but I'd eat it again.  All in all, I'd totally return if I was craving a good appetizer, needed a fun space to drink with friends, or if I wanted to play any of the fun games they play in the evening."
The Brass Tap,5,First time.  In Huntsville for Oktoberfest at The Nook Saturday night. Club atmosphere with club music playing and mostly young people.  Good beer selection.  Didn't have any food so can't say anything about the food.  Bar tenders very fun and upbeat.
The Brass Tap,4,"I'll give 5 although really I would give 4 because the lighting is soooooo bright it isn't a great place to go out for a dinner.  However the Korean bbq taco was amazingly good and the service was perfect.  I literally couldn't have had a better experience other than the crazy bright lighting.  Beers were great although the first 2 I asked for they were out and the waitress told me they will give a taste of any tap so I asked for a sample and they said ""sorry that beer is 9 dollar instead of 8 so we don't give taste for that one"".  Crazy policy.  I didn't even ask for a sample the waitress asked me lolOk I am changing to 4 stars ... but the food was amazing"
The Brass Tap,4,"Don't ask me which shopping center this is in because, well, there are a bunch of ""new"" ones all over Huntsvegas now and it's hard to keep up.But marble bar tops and dozens of taps on display kinda round out the new, trendy look for Brass Tap--across the street from Whole Foods and a stone's throw from Chuy's.Brass Tap boast #Sparta (300) selection of beers and it seems pretty legit. There's a pretty nice selection of known names and a solid mix of local representation... you know the names: Yellowhammer, rocket republic, STA, Mad Malts, Good People, efc.  But if locals and IPAs aren't your thing, there's enough bottles to still make it worth your while. Plus, for me, there's a pretty significant Belgian  representation (it's almost really good, just missing a few key names) ...in fact I might just double back on Sunday for Belgian independence day.Best thing I had today was the Rocket Republic RIS - (chocolate cherry)...and the new Holland dragon's milk was another A+ choice. That's the uppers.. Now for a few downersBeer and wings, right? So, yeah..the first foodstuffs I tried from the kitchen were the wings.  The wings come in 10 or 20 with almost a dozen flavors to choose from.  I chose Honey Hot--easily the better of the two--and the Nashville dry rub....which was underwhelming. Not bad (at all) but not spectacular by any means, either.  Deadass middle of the road. The next topic I expect them to shake off in a few weeks--and that's the pacing: you've gotta be patient (and honestly you should). They're new, they crowded and it's mad busy at Brass Tap... At least on a random summer Saturday. I'll be back to try more of the kitchen menu, which includes a few interesting items like poutine (Montréal anyone?), cheese curds (reminds me of Madison, WI) steak flatbreads and tacos.  But even if the kitchen underperforms, I'll likely pull up late after work and find some high gravity surprises on tap."
The Brass Tap,4,"UPDATE: Fish & Chips were disappointing as the fish wasn't fried long enough to be crispy and tartar sauce wasn't available. (I could make my own given mayo, pickle, onion, lemon.)"
The Brass Tap,5,61 craft beers on tap.Huuuuuuuuuge selection.Clean bartop.Good food selections.Brand new spot. 14 flatscreens.Small patio seating area.Great staff. Ask for James.
The Brass Tap,4,"Tons of beers as you may imagine by the name, but there's plenty of places to find that.  We stopped in late night on a weekday.  Food came out quick, steak tacos were good, spicy corn dip pleasantly surprised - wasn't blown away, but I'd go back. Good for sports bar atmosphere when you want more than wings and bar food."
The Brass Tap,5,"Best ""bar"" in Huntsville that we have found.First - the staff is wonderful. Second - they have 50+ draft beersThird - they have NFL Sunday ticket and plenty of tvs.Fourth - the food is good bar food. Is it the best things you've ever eaten, no, but everything tastes good and it's food you want while watching games.Give it a chance, it's a great spot!"
The Brass Tap,5,If you like the club scene but don't want to dance the brass tap is a great place to go. I've got the loud club scene music playing in the background free flowing liquor and beer and plenty of people about to chat it in full lighting. Fun engaging staff and bartenders almost like coyote ugly without the bar dancing. If you like to kick back and keep up with the current sports it's wall-to-wall TV's.
The Brass Tap,5,"I went here today for the first time.  The parking lot was busy, so I ended up parking in the overflow area. TBT has a nice atmosphere, a large beer selection, multiple TVs, and most importantly great food!!  I ordered the shrimp Caesar salad. The greens were fresh, their homemade dressing was delicious!  The shrimp were plentiful and grilled to perfection!  In my Arnold voice, ""I'll be back!!"""
The Brass Tap,4,"Every time I come back, HSV is growing. I must say that this place is a nice addition to Huntsville. There is a wide selection of beer that apparently changes quite often so don't be surprised if a fav of yours is switched out at random. The food was way better than I expected it to be. The boom boom shrimp was pretty tasty as was the burger and fries. Plenty of seating and a small outside patio. My friends and I did not realize trivia tuesday was a thing here, but we certainly learned tonight. lol Seemed like everyone participating was having a good time. I'll definitely be back to try out some other food and hopefully seek out a beer that I have no tried yet."
The Brass Tap,4,"Came at lunch on a tuesday and the place was pretty empty and we where served expeditiously.  Chicken wings where crispy outside and juicey inside, the korean sauce was really tasty.  Cheese curds where hit and crispy. Burger was also outstanding.Service was fast and friendly, and a huge beer selection.  Even NA beer for the ones who like the taste but dont want the calories"
The Brass Tap,5,"Been coming here regularly, the bartenders already know what I like to drink and they really like to get to know their customers. Always the best service. Great selection of beers and food."
The Brass Tap,3,"Very very loud the excessive noise caused errors in what we received from what we ordered. Make sure to verify with your waitress your order. The waitress came back to bragging about getting management to remove incorrect item, good communication. The waitress was very friendly and gave good recommendations on both food and drinks. Food had good taste and was adequate temperature just some items was incorrect. The shrimp platter was disappointing for the price, the flavor was good and fries are really good. Overall it's just a noise pub with ok food and good drinks."
The Brass Tap,5,Food and service is great.  Not crowded.  Beer menu is awesome.  Great place to watch a game.
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,"This is the place to go BBQ in Huntsville, AL. Don't miss the brisket, you will regret having to waste your taste buds going anywhere else."
The Chuckwagon BBQ,4,"This review is for the original location in Madison, on Hwy. 20 since I have not visited the South Parkway location. Once the stars aligned and I a. found the original Chuckwagon, and b. drove there when they were actually opened, I loved it!My husband and I got our certification as Kansas City BBQ (KCB) judges a few years back which got me on a kick to try several BBQ joints in the area. Chuckwagon does their brisket right! The line moved quickly when I queued up on my way home from work, and got to the cowboy hat wearing owner, who weighed out his beautiful brisket for me. I opted for the baked beans which were sooooooooo good! I loved that they had quite a bit of the brisket in them! So delicious and unique, at least for me.  I don't recall the other side I got, but I'll betcha it was potato salad.I liked their sauces, too!The reason for no 5th star is I thought it was a bit pricey. I'm looking forward to trying their newest location which is right up the road from me on 72 West, I think I read they are doing curbside family meals to go now."
The Chuckwagon BBQ,4,"This place is the truth! I really liked the brisket, chicken, and pulled pork. Everything was good. Service and food. They only thing that I have to say of why i gave 4 stars is that it was a little salty. But I can get past that. Cause not everything was salty, just the brisket."
The Chuckwagon BBQ,3,"My coworkers really like this place so we ordered the quarantine ""to go"" pack. Seemed like a good value. However at my house everyone found the food too Smokey, even the sauces and beans, for our taste. I appreciate what they're doing but if you don't like food extra smokey you won't care for this place."
The Chuckwagon BBQ,1,This review has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the food but everything to do with their service! I placed a fairly large order (almost $100 worth) for delivery that was cancelled without ever being notified. I assumed that the delivery company Grubhub was at fault and so I called the restaurant  (with the intention of just picking up my order instead) to confirm the order. Imagine my surprise when the representative of Chuckawagon confirmed the order had been cancelled because THEY were out of chicken (a very small portion of my order and which could have been substituted as I have a family from out of town who is now without a meal!) A simple phone call would have sufficed. Thanks Chuckawagon...will not have my business again.
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,"*** Over the years, we have taken motorcycle trip throughout the US and have visited 38 states and tried every single BBQ restaurant that we've come across. Chuckwagon had the BEST brisket i have ever eaten in my whole life and I still dream about it to this day- I literally want to get married near Huntsville just so I can get them to cater the wedding!! ***Two summers ago, we were staying in Huntsville AL and looking for some good BBQ not too far away. We chose Chuck Wagon and boy was that a great choice! Its a small little cabin on the side of the freeway, but once you walk inside, the smell of fresh BBQ is overwhelming. I had the Brisket with a side of slaw and a side of corn. The brisket was fresh and juicy- the best I have had so far. My boyfriend had the pulled pork and sausage (they were also delicious). The BBQ sauces are amazing (secret recipe).I highly recommend this restaurant!"
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,Delicious.I recommend the double brisket.And the wings!Restrooms nearby.Get there on time.Always busy.Excellent sauces.Bring an appetite.Clean. Friendly staff.
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,"Outstanding BBQ joint in Huntsville whose menu begs you to try any of the meats. From pulled pork to brisket to chicken, this place is deceptive from the outside (in a shopping plaza/strip mall) but is a can't-miss place with lots of room in back for groups to sit. If you are in Huntsville and enjoy excellent BBQ, you are nuts if you don't swing by for a meal."
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,I am a big fan of Chuckwagon BBQ and have been going to their Madison location for years so I was eager to try their new location in South Huntsville.  I was pleasantly surprised that the new location has the same menu and same quality as their original restaurant.  I got the Chuckwagon sammy with spicy sausage....oh so good...with a side of baked beans.  The decor of the new restaurant is very Texan and more roomy than the Madison location.  Chuckwagon makes the best brisket this side of Texas.  Get ya some!
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,I'm from Texas and this is the best BBQ I have ever eaten. I now live in Madison and frequented that location near home till it closed. I have patiently awaited a restart here but none seems forthcoming.Come on Mike! Restart!
The Chuckwagon BBQ,3,"Lunch regret. That's the best way to put it. I have been looking so forward to trying the new location. How disappointing. They brought everything with them but the taste. The ordering procedure, the atmosphere and the friendly service. But the taste just isn't there. I had the pulled pork and brisket. It looked amazing, it just didn't have any taste. The meats tasted like they had been on the smoker for an hour then put in a instapot. Very little smoke ring on the brisket and the pulled pork was watery. Sorry guys, but you have got to up your game or you won't last."
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,"Oh man, oh man. I have been craving some good BBQ this week and I'm so pleased that I stopped by to give Chuck's a try while in the area. I ordered the 2 meats plate because 1 just wouldn't do. I came with an appetite, lol. All of the meats looked exceptionally delicious and I'm pretty sure I began salivating while watching the cook slice my requested meats - ribs and hot sausage; succulent cuts of meat and plentiful for me. The ribs were just a tad bit on the bland side. Definitely smoked but lacked some seasoning. The plate comes with two sides and a choice of bread in which I ordered the southwest mac n cheese (decent), potato salad (grand slam) and jalapeno cornbread (top notch). The plate was about $16 bucks after tax but for the portion and quality of food given, it was so worth it. I had plenty left over to eat on the next day. My plate was loaded with a variety of flavor notes - smokiness, spiciness and sweetness. Sooooo much gratification. I did request a 'hot' bbq sauce and white sauce but only used a little of the two for the ribs, for flavor. A little goes a long way with the 'hot' bbq sauce. Thick consistency and full of heat.  My to go service was quick and pleasant. The wait staff was very polite. I would definitely go back to try more of their selections and desserts."
The Chuckwagon BBQ,2,"Previously I had lunched at their old place off Wall Triana. That was always a pleasant experience.Today I launched at their South Pkwy location. I got a sliced brisket sandwich, potato salad and a coke.Quality is very good.Meat portion on my sandwich was ""meager"", and less than what a seven and a half dollar sandwich should have.The potato salad was one leveled ice cream scoop that was almost two and a half dollars. Quite meager for the price also.The coke was as expected.My lunch (even the potato salad) was served on a pieces of paper placed on a metal tray. Overall I say that the management is showing too much stinginess and if they don't make positive changes, will have a diminishing number of diners."
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,"I have chosen to base my star rating solely on the main entree and probably the most popular, brisket. Having said that, if someone asked how bbq brisket should be, I would most likely say to get it here. In general, bbq places tend to either over trim or under trim the fat off of their brisket so you end up with mostly a fatty brisket or a very dry one. Not here. They have perfect amount of fat where the brisket comes out perfectly cooked and super juicy. The cow from which the meat has come from has been done justice. They also offer other sides such as a home made bake bean which is smoky and flavorful with good texture, a super delicious potato salad, slaw (which I did not try), etc served with either a jalapeño cornbread or a roll. That jalapeño cornbread is very good. Biting into it revealed a wonderfully moist bread with corn kernels and bits of jalapeño. Very good.I did try the peanut butter pie. It was good but in my opinion too sweet. A good dessert when made well really doesn't need so much sugar.All of this was washed down by perfect sweet tea. All in all a super generous portion matching the price.The only thing I would change is probably have a smaller version of the meat plates for less cost because you are looking at over $12 a plate. Don't get scared by the cost though because it is a lot of meat and great sides. I ordered the one-meat plate and was only able to eat half and then ate the rest for afternoon meal. I will definitely come back."
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,Came in around 11am on a Thursday and was glad to see it was practically empty.  Got 2 meat (brisket and pulled pork) with potato salad and beans.  Everything was AMAZING except the potato salad (too sweet imo).  First time at this location and a long-time visitor of the original location.  Love the hot sauce.
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,This place has the best stuffed bake potato in town.  The Texas brisket is outstanding!  I've enjoyed most of the sides as well.  Don't tell my mom that I said Chuckwagon cornbread is better!
The Chuckwagon BBQ,3,The food was decent people weren't very talkative asked questions and got nothing but food was good work on making sure your staff is more friendly
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,This restaurant is in a shopping center and is not much to look at from the outside. The inside is much cuter and the booths are great. You feel there is some privacy in them. The brisket is the best I ever had.  It was very tender and had a nice finish on the outside. We also had pulled pork and sausage.Their potato salad is really good. There Alabama white sauce was excellent. My wife said she thought it made the Bbq. There red sauces were ok. Nothing special. This is the one area they could improve.
The Chuckwagon BBQ,5,"The Pulled Pork Sandwich is big enough to share, if you're willing to ask them to cut it in half.  It is excellent.  I'd pass on the average french Fries, and get their Potato Salad instead.  It is at least very good, maybe excellent."
The Chuckwagon BBQ,4,"Think they're relocating.  First time I went, it was great.  Second time was solid.  I'd return.  Had ribs, chicken (just ok), brisket, and sausage I believe between the two visits."
Hippea Camper,5,"Not only are the people great but the food is so Good! Grits, Amazing. Carrot Lox Bagel, Delish. Granola, perfect and not overly sweet like most. Pimento Spread, Love it!! Healthier versions of food we love that also saves an animals life. Yes Please."
Hippea Camper,5,"Wow, this place is awesomely tasty! Service was fast and very friendly. I purchased the hot tamale bowl and I was extremely impressed with how flavorful it was. The next day i had the Chickpea salad and lemonade. Also really good! The Only downfall is that it is a little expensive for the amount of food you get."
Purveyor Huntsville,5,"My wife and I had a late Valentine's day dinner here. Late because I'm not young enough to worry about having V-day on V-day. I hope my wife feels the same or I'm in deep trouble. Again.Anyway, no way I could have gotten a res for Valentine's day by the time I would have gotten around to it. At least I assume so. Monday after the 14th - MONDAY - the place was packed. Pretty proud of myself for having reserved the spot through the reservation system. Go there.The mixed drinks menu is fun. It's a big one, pasted into a big book. My wife has a good time paging through it and looking up all the weird drinks on her phone. I like tequila. OK, so they were out of the tequila I wanted. I also like rye.The waiter recommended the house rye. It was horrible. Until I started on the wonderful cute little loaf of bread with garlic and cheese and butter. Mmm. Made the rye really, really good. Get that. The waiter informed us that the steak special would be delicious and cost $101. I just don't like steak that much. The market price on scallops was reasonable, might try that next time. The venison and the bulgogi-style pork sounded great, as did the chicken. Dang it, everything sounded good. Definitely need to come back and try everything.The fish was halibut. I love halibut. It's calm, not mild. It's just a little sweet, just barely earthy. It's a great fish to show off what is around it, but very, very easy to overwhelm; very easy to make the sweetness disappear or make it taste muddy instead of earthy. The sauce described on the menu was meant to play with any fish, but dang it - halibut isn't any fish. (No fish is any fish, y'all!) But play it did. The fish and the sauce enjoyed being together. The sauce was a little stronger, could have been dialed down just a quarter of a tad, but there was the halibut in there, enjoying the attention the sauce paid it. All good. No, all excellent. Now, the risotto was a little on the fair side, gummier than I'd recommend. But the asparagus made up for it. Bottom line: get the halibut if it's offered.My wife loved her lamb. I loved her lamb. It was even better than the halibut. It was the best lamb I've ever had, I think, and I'm from a traditional English family who cooked lamb the way other people cook hamburgers. Well, maybe not that often, but it was all but a staple. This lamb was seriously, seriously wonderful. Melted in my mouth. Sauced perfectly. Decorated tastily with roasted veggies, colorful and crunchy. Get that. Mmm.We didn't do dessert. Betting it's great. The check was a little less than I'd expected at $150 with tip. Much higher than, say, 1892 East, but for an occasion like Valentine's day with a really great woman, it's a bargain. Go there. It's excellent. (To my wife: I love you that much. Thanks for being there with me!)"
Purveyor Huntsville,5,"I was happily surprised by my husband with a birthday dinner. I've been fortunate enough to dine at 5 star restaurants in Las Vegas and Orange County, so I was beyond pleased to enjoy a 5 star meal in Alabama. We started the meal with Ahi Tacos. They were fresh & crunchy with just the right amount of spice. I will definitely be stopping by often just to snack on these. The scallops were perfectly cooked and tender. Each bite filled with an assortment of flavors that burst in my mouth. The star of the evening was their Kobe beef, served with grilled prawns and crab creamed corn. The beef was so tender it melted in my mouth. The prawns were huge & deliciously seasoned. The cream corn was the best I've ever tasted with generous lumps of crab. For dessert we had a trio of deliciousness. The cheesecake was served with a tasty rompope sauce but the chocolate bread pudding was so amazing it left me wanting more. I expected a good meal but we were given a phenomenal dining experience. Thank you Purveyor for making my birthday such a memorable one."
Purveyor Huntsville,1,Purveyor is currently selling off their liquor inventory. Their inflated prices are absolutely shameful. $133 for a $33 rum? $1200 for a $700 liqueur? This will make me think twice about ever patronizing this business again. Someone posted ABC price pictures on their Facebook page and they have been taken down. Really?
Purveyor Huntsville,4,"Nice lively atmosphere with good food and drinks. Service was also great, something we found everywhere in Huntsville!We had the duck wings (just okay for me though everyone else in my group loved them), duck meatballs which were also ok and the fried lobster avocado roll which was the best thing I had!"
Purveyor Huntsville,5,"We had a great experience on NYE! It was super easy making a reservation on the website. The atmosphere of the restaurant was warm and cozy. I absolutely loved how the cocktail menu was inserted into the pages of old books and the drinks were named after women in history. The food was outstanding! The dishes were creative and everything was cooked perfect. What impressed me the most was the service. Our water glasses were always full and nothing was ever overlooked. They also have a guest WiFi, just ask the server for the password! This is one of our new favorite downtown restaurants!"
Purveyor Huntsville,5,The steak I ate was a special but it was special probably the best steak I have ever eatan hands down.
Purveyor Huntsville,5,Service A++++Atmosphere A+Food Quality A+I really love purveyor. Their Ahi tuna tacos are fabulous to start with. The filet is always cooked to perfection and the service is awesome. I have never once seen my water glass get below half. Everyone is constantly checking on tables.
Purveyor Huntsville,5,"As a seasoned traveler and one who is new to Huntsville, I must say that Purveyor is hands-down the best high-end restaurant in Huntsville! Being from NYC, and have lived in SF, Atlanta and Chicago, I am amazes at the level of excellence that Purveyor's cuisine provides. All that is topped with their even more amazing mixologist drinks... they absolutely get it right! Purveyor has become our special date treat that has not disappointed!"
Purveyor Huntsville,4,"Love this place for date night or girls night out. I highly recommend just getting the small plates/appetizers and sharing them with your friends instead of doing entrees. The entrees that I have had have been good, but the appetizers are so much better.  The ahi poke tacos and bone marrow are my top two appetizers that I tell everyone to try. The cocktails are also amazing. They can make a drink based on whatever flavors you like. So my rating is a 5 stars to the appetizers and drinks, 4 stars to the entrees and atmosphere."
Purveyor Huntsville,5,"With my busy life here in Hunstville, I try to make it a priority to spend time with my friends-- over an amazing meal that is. Last night, two very gorgeous women I know joined me for dinner at @purveyorhuntsville and it was quite an experience! I love digging through this city to find gems like this one. Personality of the place: Old English/French/ Scottish speak easy pub, but with a more exquisite dining experience. Great selection of music also. Entree|Scottish Pink Salmon- Pan seared crispy skin fillet, pickled red cabbage veloute purée(veloute is French for velvety) grilled asparagus, olive lemon butter. Colorful garnish complements the dish with accents of summer, France and Scotland. Shareables| French Lollipop Wings- Bourbon teriyaki bbq, bleu cheese & port foam. (MY FAVE!) Drunken Guacamole- I am so weird about avocados. Hate the texture, but love some good guacamole. This guacamole is slamming, probably the best I've ever had. Organic avocado, goat cheese crumbles, Woodford pico de gallo, cassava chips. The cocktail menu is inside of a novel and the food is outstanding and very reasonably priced. I look forward to having more girls night out's here!"
Purveyor Huntsville,4,"I've been back 4 times since my original review. Surprisingly, I have enjoyed it better each time. Maybe my first experiences were just on off nights or the result of being a new restaurant that hadn't figured out its niche. Who knows. But like their wonderful wine selection, the restaurant itself just gets better with age."
Purveyor Huntsville,5,"This review is about our visit in early May 2019. I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet!My husband and I chose Purveyor to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. We were blown away! Without them even knowing it was a special date, we were seated in a lovely semi-private wine cellar. The drinks were wonderful, and the appetizer was incredible. We got the French lollipop wings. We couldn't believe how good they were! On to our entrees, I got a pasta dish which was superb, and my husband got the sea bass. We have NEVER had such melt in your mouth delicious fish. Not even on our many beach trips. For a dessert we had bread pudding because we just couldn't resist. It was also amazing. The presentation of everything was beautiful. My husband travels a lot for business, about 2 months of the year and he said it's in the top restaurants he's ever been too. For me it's my number 1! We are planning on celebrating our 11 year anniversary here as well. :) Our server was friendly and very good at his job. He didn't hover but was always there when we needed something. This place is way better than Commerce Kitchen, in our experience. We have also been in to purchase a gift card and the bartenders are very funny and charming."
Purveyor Huntsville,5,"A dining experience! I read the reviews and had to check this place. My daughter and I stopped in and were asked if we had reservations. We said no and were told they would have no openings for another 2 hours, but that there were two openings at the bar. So we headed to the bar. When you read the menu, your taste buds will start to dance. Everything sounds amazing. We ordered drinks and a few apps. When the food was served, now your eyes are dancing. Great presentation of everything we ordered. Better yet, it tasted just as good as it looked! Paired with a glass of wine, my dinner was excellent. Loved the service from the bartenders! Definitely recommend for anyone visiting Huntsville."
Purveyor Huntsville,4,I was in town for a conference and decided to give it a try here as I had never ate here before. I ordered prime rib and my business associate had the coffee strip steak. Both items were very good and the coffee steak was good and not filled with an overpowering coffee taste. My prime rib was also very good. Overall a great evening and I would eat here again for sure.
Purveyor Huntsville,5,We had dinner here for my husband's birthday and it was amazing! Great food and service! The atmosphere was so much fun. Kind of had the feel of an old speakeasy. It was noisy but not in a way that was uncomfortable. Even with all of the other people around it still felt cozy and we were able to be in our own little bubble. I loved that the service was on point! We will absolutely add this to our rotation of favorite spots to dine!
Purveyor Huntsville,5,"I LOVE this place!!! Great cocktails, awesome food, trendy atmosphere...it does not get better in Huntsville!"
Purveyor Huntsville,5,"This place is a must. It is hip, energetic, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is perfection. If I lived in Alabama, I would eat here every week. Every table inside and out was filled at 8:30 on a Tuesday night with young professionals and 1000 conversations that made me want to move into the trendy condos above the restaurant. Jordan B was our server and he's the most adorable human being I've ever met and gives me hope for all millennials. We had ahi tacos, charred broccolini, salmon, Sauvignon Blanc, and Yellowhammer beer."
Purveyor Huntsville,3,We went there to celebrate a friends birgday! Great atmosphere! Nice portions. Good meat and vegetarian options. Friendly servers. Excellent desserts. Had a fun time!
Purveyor Huntsville,2,"Food is good and interesting cocktails.That's where the good part of this review ends.  I'd using the following to describe our experience overall:  rude, pretentious, discriminatory & pompoms.   Why such harsh words?  I'll explain.My friend and I were in town on Saturday for the boat show.  After the show, we reviewed the different places on Yelp for dinner and Church Street Purveyor sounded great and...I'm a huge fan of tapas.We walked into the restaurant and it was about half full and the bar was open so we made our way in and here's where things went south (pun intended) we happened to be speaking in Spanish and all three bartenders gave us a look.  Yeah...that MAGA look. We tried to engage with the bartenders and received one-word answers and lot's of attitude so we proceeded to order a few plates and continued our conversation vacillating between English and Spanish. About a half hour into our meal the bartender (Morgan)  was attempting to mix some type of drink and we asked what it was - one-word answer then silence.  All the other bartenders were sipping the drink to taste and we joked ""hey, we'll be your guinea pigs"" - blank stares and then silence.We finished dinner and left.  As we started to drive home my friend noticed he didn't have his debit card with him and thought he left it in the checkbook.  We were about 20 minutes away so he called - told the person who answered the situation and she returned in a few minutes and said: ""the bartenders said there wasn't any card"".  My friend was pretty confident he had left it so he asked "" would you please ask, check again"" to which the person on the phone said ""yeah, I'll check again later before I leave tonight"" WTF?So, we turned around, drove back and went to bar and guess what - one of the bartenders had the card in his shirt pocket and gave a sheepish apology when my friend asked for it.So $170 dollars to experience good food and terrible service."
Purveyor Huntsville,5,"High end food for Huntsville. It's going to give the other spots a run for their money. I love food and beverage that challenges my expectations and leaves me eager to try more of what they have to offer. We tried four cocktails, three shareables, one entree, and one dessert. We enjoyed every crumb, every drop. Atmosphere was nice, intimate. Suggestions: turn off the tv and ask the servers to give a little space. We felt rushed."
Peppered Pig,5,"Been far too long between visits but my go to was the Cuban B burger. Bulgogi burger was also a tasty bite to steal from my lunch mate.I've never seen them put a foot wrong here. The food is consistently good, the order is always right, and the service is always great."
Peppered Pig,5,"I haven't been able to make it out to this food truck because I'm mostly located in Madison and the location by Packards Antiques is further than I like to go. BUT I've heard enough about it that I had to try it. I was not disappointed. First, I was greeted by the friendliest lady. She made ordering easy and pleasant. I ordered the Bulgogi burger (cut in half)and friesMy food came out in less than 10 minutes. It seemed pretty quick. The burger was delicious. You can tell it was made fresh and with top notch ingredients. The kimchi was also delicious. I was told the cook makes it himself. Yum! There are only 2 outdoor tables so seating is limited. Be prepared for that if it's busy. Oh, and bring wipes. If you eat this burger you will be covered in delicious kimchi/bulgogi juices and will need them in the end."
Peppered Pig,5,"I must shout from a mt. top that this place has the best burgers in Huntsville, Alabama and the tastiest bbq.This is a must stop in Huntsville!"
Peppered Pig,5,I've been wanting to try this place for a while after my moms friend suggested this place. We arrived to the food truck and were greeted nicely and we received great service. We ordered the Bulgogi burger suggested by my moms friend who claims that it's the best. We also ordered the seasoned fries for our side. I don't remember how long we waited but it wasn't more than 10 minutes. Unfortunately it was raining that day so we didn't sit on the bench or the table in front of the truck for customers. As we got our ordered we headed home and opened our bag to be hit with an amazing smell. The fries were crispy yet so soft on the inside with the perfect amount of seasoning and saltines and it came with ketchup. We then opened our Bulgogi burger and it looked a bit different then I expected. We cut ours in 4 so we could share it and 1/4 was enough for me because it filled me up real quick. As I bit into the Bulgogi burger all our doubts vanished because it was honestly one of the best and most flavorful burger I've ever had. The rice inside was nicely roasted on the outside and the marinated sauce went perfectly with the meat and everything else in it. I paid $12 in total for my order and I consider that a bit pricey but I definitely don't regret it.
Peppered Pig,5,"Yuuuuuuuuum.Okay, so Peppered Pig is a food truck that primarily stays parked on South Parkway.  Had a little bit of a hard time finding it, but just use your GPS to get to Packard's Antiques and it'll be waiting for you in the parking lot.  There are two patio tables in front of the truck, so there is seating -- but it's very limited, so you may have to eat in your car.  Don't worry, it's worth it.  The menu consists of several fancy burgers, usually loaded with cool and interesting toppings like kimchi or pork belly.  If that's a little too much for you, you can get a Plain Jane; that's probably what I'd get if the burger of the week hadn't been a mushroom and Swiss burger.  Oh, you can also get a couple other kinds of sandwiches (grilled cheese, chicken sandwich, etc) and catfish tacos.  Loaded and plain fries can be added, as well as creme pies for dessert! As I mentioned, I split the mushroom and Swiss burger of the week with my mom.  The extremely pleasant lady working the cash register informed us it'll likely become a permanent menu fixture, which is exciting.  We also split an order of Cajun fries.  You probably will want to split these sandwiches whenever possible, because I can throw down and the half burger and fries was still gut busting for me at lunch.  Oh, but it's so good though.  Absolutely beautiful, beefy, savory, juicy burgers on a perfectly soft bun, more meaty mushrooms, smooth Swiss cheese, and this AMAZING garlicky mayonnaise.  It was sublime; definitely one of the best burgers in Huntsville.  The fries were cooked super fresh, and were so hot we could barley touch them at first.  Very crispy and tasty.  My one smaaaaaall complaint is that they could've used a bit more of the seasoning on them to give them an extra flavorful punch.   But it's an extremely minor nitpick in the face of a phenomenal sandwich experience.Can't wait to go back!"
Peppered Pig,5,"Moved here in May, this is hands down the best food I've had in Alabama! I had the piggy, my coworker had the bugogi burger and we tried to share the Cuban b fries, I also got a deviled egg for later! It took me two full sittings to eat my 1 piggy burger and it was amazing! My coworker along with everyone waiting raved about the bugogi burger! The little bit I could eat of the fries was amazing and my burger heated up well later! This is the 1st place I'd take anyone visiting me in Huntsville that's a meat eater! If you couldn't tell by the name vegans and vegetarians stay clear! Pescatarians get the catfish tacos!"
Peppered Pig,5,My husband and I ate here for the first time today. I had the cat tacos (catfish tacos) and he had the bacon cheeseburger and fries. It was all amazing!  And the lady at the window that took our order was so super nice!  We will be back!
Peppered Pig,5,"Came here for lunch with a friend. I didn't know this food truck existed and had to try it after seeing its reviews. My friend and I both got the specialty burgers and ate outside. The burgers were as big wide as they were tall! Wow were they amazing! The ones we ordered had jalapeño poppers and a habanero sauce in them and were delicious! Besides that, we just got some fries to share, but could hardly finish them because the burgers were so massive.If you haven't tried this place, definitely consider giving it a shot. The staff are very nice and don't cheap out on the amount of meat they'll put in your burger."
Peppered Pig,5,"I'm lucky enough to work for an employer who travels to this fine establishment once a week to pick us up food for lunch.  I've had about everything on the menu, and if there's one that sticks out, it's this:  everything tastes extremely fresh and as if it was made with a lot, a lot, a lot of love.It's not a very extensive menu, but all of the protein options are outstanding, and they have always been really good about modifications.  They also do weekly specials that are ""off-menu"" and can be found on the homepage of their website (a couple off the top of my head would be the Blackened Salmon BLT, the Heifer with Cheese, and the Bacon Bomb).My favorite thing to do is to order my burger or sandwich ""bun-less"".  Everything comes separated in a big to-go box and I've always found to get a lil' more meat that way.  Anyways, do yourself a favor and try this local joint.  It's a great experience and one you cannot find anywhere else in Huntsville."
Peppered Pig,5,Bulgolgi Burger if the boom hand down not to mention the oatmeal pies. I've never had anything bad from there!
Peppered Pig,5,"WOW!!! WOW!! What took me so long to get here?!! I've had Peppered Pig bookmarked for some time and finally caved in. I was in the mood for a GOOD beef burger and since I was in the area, decided to see what all the hype was about. After much contemplating and drooling over their menu selections, I decided to order the weekly special, Bacon Bomb Burger. I opted out on fries because I wanted to enjoy as much of this burger as I could. I knew I was in over my head with this burger but hey, ""Go hard or Go home"". B-)First bite drove my tastebuds into an absolute frenzy! Every bite was sensational, loaded with layers of yumminess. I definitely tapped out after devouring the 1st half (LOL) and saved the 2nd half for later. Looking forward to trying the bulgogi burger and country boy burger. Then again, who am I kidding?!! I want to try them all! :)Service was SUPER pleasant and quick!"
Peppered Pig,5,Oh my gosh! Sandwiches the size of your head! Very delicious - leave your calorie calculator at home. Ha!
Peppered Pig,5,One of if not the best burger in town.  It is  a food truck and the line can get long because the food is incredible.  Bring an umbrella if it's raining because the food is worth the wait!
Peppered Pig,5,"I should eventually try something besides the knuckle sandwich, but it's difficult when the sandwich is so good. My wife enjoyed the plain Jane, and the fries are very good.  The people who work there are always nice, and definitely make you feel welcome. I've seen others call their orders in ahead, which is a good idea if you're in a hurry. Seating is very limited, so be prepared to wait or eat in your car. All in all, highly recommended."
Peppered Pig,5,Everything after I had is been excellent. You can tell a lot of thought when into the Burgers and sandwiches. And I don't think it's possible they could be any nicer
Peppered Pig,5,Sooooo good.  Loved everything about it.  The burger was huge and amazing.  The fries were seasoned perfectly.  It can be messy but with their foil and napkins I was fine.  Will be back.
Peppered Pig,5,Holy cow! This place is delicious! The bulgogi burger and cheese fries are enough food to feed two people. This is a food truck so there is no air conditioned seating option. Not usually a problem unless you are from a Northern state and not used to the heat.
Peppered Pig,5,This place is amazing!  I got the mushroom Swiss burger which isn't available all the time but my god it was delicious.  The lady taking my order was super sweet and very attentive. I dare to say this is the best burger spot in Huntsville!
Peppered Pig,5,Fantastic burgers and fries. Try anything on special! They obviously know what they are doing and take pride in a quality product.
Peppered Pig,5,"Just WOW, I didnt even think I would find it after looking on herw but the reviews sokd me. And then the 2 behind the counter seriously made it great. A burger with bacon, pulled pork, slaw and more slaw cause it was so amazing. Going again tomorrow while I'm in town."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"Went here just before they shit down in house services. I'm not sure if they're doing curbside during this time or not. If you like Korean food that tastes homemade and friendly service this is the place to go! The food is great and most people looking to eat here are regulars or know the owner, so I'll tailor my review towards someone who's thinking about trying this place. If you're new to Korean food, my favorite has always been a spicy pork or bulgogi bibimbap. Make sure you try the little side dishes they give you and always feel free to ask for a little more if you particularly like one :) Will definitely have to come here again when I'm back in Huntsville and quarantine is lifted!"
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"My favorite Korean place in the area. The owner is super nice and the food tasty. I also like it's authentic, homey vibe. There's even a Go board if you fancy taking on the world's oldest (and arguably most difficult to master) board game.The dolsot bibimbop is a must try, kinda like a Korean version of fajitas, with barbecue beef, stir-fried onions, crispy rice on the bottom, fried egg on the top, and condiments on the side--kimche, potatoes, fish cakes, cucumber. It's delcious and fun, but watch out or you'll burn your tongue, as it's served piping hot on a sizzling stone."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,3,"For Huntsville, Shinsegae was very unique. It was located in a run-down plaza, but the interior felt very homey. When we went, the wait was extremely long, probably about 30 minutes to order and then an hour more for food, including banchan. There was only one waiter who also cashiered, so we tried to be patient. He was so nice and extremely friendly!The banchan was great when it arrived. I enjoyed the potatoes and fish cakes most. I ordered a seafood soondubu-jjigae and my friend ordered jajangmyeon. I love soondubu, but the soup here was very watery and had little flavor. The seafood was cooked well though. The jajangmyeon was tasty.I liked Shinsegae enough to come back, especially with no major Asian market or other Korean restaurants in the area. I do think I prefer family cooking to the restaurant, but I'd support this friendly family business!"
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"Absolutely love the owner and the food!  Very delicious food at a good price.  Definitely not somewhere to go for ""atmosphere"" but to simply eat great food.  Always my go to place for Korean food in town."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"For the Huntsville area, this place gets 5 stars. I finished my tofu stew because it was so satisfying! Service was a bit slow, but the owner/waiter was apologetic. For such a tiny place that was packed, it was understandable in the moment. They take card, have self serve tea (unlimited!), and tons of parking in the lot. Can't wait to come back!"
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"We are new to the Huntsville area coming from Rome, GA (1h30m from Atlanta, GA). So when I googled Korean restaurants and found more than 0, I was ecstatic!!!!We chose this place because it was the closest to our house & was opened at the time we were starving (around 11am on a Sunday). The restaurant is not located in the nicest area, and the outside looks very run down, so naturally I knew it was going to be good. The inside is little, probably sits no more than 30 peeps. It felts like we were sitting in someone's home, which I thought was rather lovely. It's a little family owned business so my husband and are always up for supporting them! I ordered the squid stir-fried noodle (squid japchae) and the husband got the Dolsot Bibimbab. Portions were generous and flavor was on pointtttt. We were VERY surprised to how good the dishes were. Super authentic. Service was very friendly;I believe the owner is the one who waited on us. He spoke minima English, but was very accommodating and friendly. Prices were fair and totally justifiable based on the delicious meals we had. Needless to say. We. Will. Be. Back."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,4,Beef bulgogi was very good but more steamed than the type of bulgogi I tried all over the world including Korea. Service was very good place is on small side and could use just a little updating . Really resembles South Korea restaurants. We'll try it again differently something different.
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"The best Korean food in town for sure. Service can sometimes be slow if it gets busy, but thats because there is only one person cooking the food and that makes it so worth it. The stone pot bibimbap is one of my favorites but all of the stews are also a go to. I take all of my out of town friends here for some good down home korean cooking."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"They said go here if you want authentic Korean food. Indeed this is the right place to go when you crave for Korean food. I love the bibimbap! They have the regular bowl bibimbap (still huge for me) and they have the bigger plate(sizzling) too.  So what i love also is that tea is free, kimchi, spicy cucumber, other two side dishes are also free. Be warned that lunch time would take longer for your food to be served since there's a lot of people there. So maybe go there when it's not busy.  Although the outside may look a little run down, but the food is great and staff were very nice."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,4,"Here visiting and decided to try this place after work. It has ample seating and took me back to being in Korea. It does take a few minutes before he came to take my order, even with everyone (3 others) already placing their order. I would hate to see if this place was packed. I ordered the tofu  soup which I thought was suppose to have pork, veggies, and soft tofu. It had a couple shrimp and calamari with lots of tofu. It didn't matter cause it was still delicious and tasty. The bonchon was ok, they had the potato, kimchi, cucumber kimchII, and fish cake. Will check out the other Korean restaurants around the area to compare."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,4,"This is a nice restaurant and deserves a good review. It is one of those hole in the wall restaurant that I would not have found if it wasn't for yelp. Testimony that they serve good food is the fact that there were Korean people eating there.All that said, this is the first time I have Korean food and probably will be the last. Again I say, not the fault of the restaurant, is not them is me, I did not like the flavors. But if you are going to try Korean for the first time I would recommend this place. Service was excellent and the food came fast enough."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"Great Korean food.  That spicy Korean ramyun is  .  Customer service is great, just a good little shop.  Never been disappointed."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"I am a regular at this restaurant when I am able to go after coming home from college. All my friends come here, my older brother and his friends come here. They have never disappointed me. While the wait is sometimes long but it's always worth it. This is one of my favorite restaurants. My favorite dishes are japchae-bulgogi, dolsot bibimbap(cause it cooks while you eat its great) and I don't know the Korean name but description says its rice cakes and dumplings in beef broth but it tastes amazing especially in winter. Also the kimchi is always delicious."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,4,Foods and service are greatjust have to wait for a while because of lacking of staffs. Which is why I give 4 stars. But this is definitely the place to go for foods. It's best if you go at a time where it is not busy.
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"Ordered bibimbap takeout and it was ready quickly, tasted amazing, generous portion size, and great price. Definitely going to pay a visit soon."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,I absolutely love this restaurant. It is the most authentic Korean restaurant in Huntsville. The owner is so sweet and takes care of all of his customers. He always recognizes me when I come in and the prices are good for what amount of food you'll end up getting! It's also tasty and I love going here to eat whenever I can!
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,What a great find!! Needed food close to our hotel and we wanted some sort of Asian food. Shinsegae was perfect. My picky son loves bulgogi so we thought we would try it. We couldn't be more glad. Perfectly cooked beef and vegetables. Absolutely delicious. But the best part were the sides! Kimchi was hot but not deadly. Loved the cucumbers and the potatoes. Highly recommend.
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,4,"Don't be afraid.  Go in. Order Topokki, Bulgolgi, Haemul Pajeon, Bimbimbap. And a Coke to wash it down. Watch the Korean satellite shows. Smile. Leave a good tip. Drink tea from the carafe. Rinse. Repeat. You're welcome."
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"We ordered take out on a very busy Sunday afternoon. The owner was nice and seated us while he tended to other customers. They seemed a little overwhelmed, so patience was needed -- but the food was really worth the wait!"
Shinsegae Oriental Restaurant,5,"Best Korean in Huntsville by far.  I've had spicy pork and stir-fry (spicy) squid and both were phenomenal.  Lunch menu prices start around $6.99 and huge portions.  If you're in Huntsville and like Korean food, Shinsegae is a must try."
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,These guys are making my favorite burger these days.  It is hard to beat Five Guys but these guys do it for me.  They have GF buns and I always get two patties to savor the taste of the grass fed fresh beef.  If you are going to order darker than medium just go to McDonalds.
Farm Burger Huntsville,5,"This cute quick burger place caught my eye as I was out exploring the area. The service was sweet and southern. The food came out fast! They have Abita root beer on draft. It's refreshing! I ordered the farm burger which had aged white cheddar, caramelized onions, their special thousand island sauce and pasture raised bacon! I had it lettuce wrapped and added sweet potato fries. Everything was very tasty!!"
Farm Burger Huntsville,1,Burgers are very good. Sweet potato fries were terrible mushy and limp. I go here all the time and today was the worst!
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,"The freshness and variety are what make this place 4 stars. I'm always a fan of grass-fed beef and I appreciate the approach they have with their food. They aim for simplicity, they support their local farmers, and they want clients to have a more intimate relationship with their food. I love the fact that they're using an invasive species of blue catfish for their current special.With that said, their burger meat is severely under-seasoned for my preferences. This might be good for those avoiding salt, but it was rather disappointing for me. No amount of sauce saved it.I will say that the meat was very fresh with minimal grit though. And all of the toppings were fresh.The sauces were great. The FB sauce tasted as if tartar sauce and russian dressing had a baby. Their mustard was grainy and my favourite. They also used it for their kale slaw which was my favourite aspect. I enjoyed the fact that you could get more than fries or onion rings with your burger. If you're a health nut with a burger hankering, this joint is definitely for you."
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,"Definitely digging their concept of grass fed and grass finished meat! Kudos to you! The size of the patty was generous. Flavor was on point. I ordered mine a medium but in hindsight I shoulda gone with medium rare. It was a hair too dry. The side of bone marrow for 3$ was a nice little touch. I would've liked something hard and crunchy to go with it. I decided to slather it on my burger since it needed some moisture and that was a nice flavor burst!!!My kids burger was so small it looked like a yo-yo. She begged me for some dessert since she was still hungry. They ran out of root beer for floats so we settled on chocolate milkshakes. Those were TASTY! Sweet potato fries was also well seasoned and crispy. Regular fries were also perfect. I had to take off a star for running out of root beer at 1:00 pm on a Sunday. C'mon guys! On a hot Alabama day, root beer float would've made my day! My daughter's burger was way too small even for a kid. Need to step up the size and not be so stingy. Other than that, I'll be back!"
Farm Burger Huntsville,1,"UPDATE: Now, they get toppings right (except my medium well Farmburger was missing the cheese), but we are served tiny pieces of fries that must be eaten with a fork (whether we order French fries or sweet potato fries) while we notice others in the restaurant get served normal sized fries. No tip for you. Pricey and consistently bad experience."
Farm Burger Huntsville,5,"One of the shining stars from our trip. Honestly Huntsville felt like a food desert and Farm Burger was a diamond in the rough. Nestled between Whole Foods and a few other posh stores Lululemon, Orange Theory, etc., Farm Burger did not disappoint. We tried carry-out and the food took a while to come out but they were slammed on the Friday night we went so it's understandable. We decided to build our own burgers and every bite was perfection. Burgers were grass fed, juicy, and perfectly cooked. Our hands and mouths were covered in deliciousness so bring extra napkins and thank me later. The menu is small but what they do have they make very well. If you have time, they have a nice outdoor sitting area that people eat and drink on. Definitely worth a visit. No pictures this time because we ate everything in the car on the go!"
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,"I have been here two times and both times there was a very long line! I take that to mean it is amazing! I had the sandwich of the day and it was delicious. Fries are yumminess. My husband is such a picky eater, and he raved over the burger! We aren't local, but will put this on our must eat when visiting!"
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,"Bumping off a star like everyone else because of the high prices. But the burgers are good. I always get the classic farm burger which has their sauce and caramelized onions on it. Always order the garlic fries too. So much garlic and its so good. Fried not included with the burger though, bummer. The staff is always friendly too."
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,"This was my first visit. I had heard how wonderful it was. Well, it was better than a burger from a fast food place but no where near the best burger I have ever had. Which, ironically enough, was homemade. My burger was a little dry and had a chunk of gristle (of something unedible) in it. I expected a lot more flavor since the bacon was cooked inside the patty. Ah, nope, neither.Will I go back again? Yes. Will I rush to do so? Not really. Will I recommend to friends? Probably but only as a suggestion."
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,"Dropped by this place for lunch today and this place was popping. I ordered the lunch combo which comes with a build your own burger, fries, and drink, for a very reasonable price. The burger meat was a little dry, but there is a huge selection of topping choices. Some are free and some you have to pay for. The FB fries are also amazing! It's slathered in Parmesan and garlic, yummy. My friend ordered the bone marrow as a side for $3 and that was delicious as well. Overall this place is worth a visit!"
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,"I really enjoy Farmburger and am really glad I stumbled upon this place. Service is fast and friendly. Burgers are decently sized, juicy and flavorful. I am in love with their classic Farmburger. Kids meals are a little rough, at least the cheeseburger one. The burger was smaller than a standard slider, which makes for a very tiny burger.  Fresh, seasonal fruit also apparently includes carrots, who knew. My only complaint is their sweet potato fries. They someone managed to make them both soggy AND overcooked. If they could get that sorted out, the place would easily be 5 stars. Bonus points for eating locally sourced food, and a company that uses cardboard to go containers instead of Styrofoam. Prices are a little up there, for three burgers, one order of sweet potato fries and a kids meal, it ran us a little over $50."
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,"Friendly staff. Delicious, tasty burger and fires. 4 stars simply because the price is a little steep for a burger joint."
Farm Burger Huntsville,5,Great burger. I had the sunny-side and it was phenomenal. Everyone with me tried something different and are as pleased as I. Yummmm
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,"Visiting my son at UAH so we decided to try.  Well apparently a quarter of Huntsville was in this shopping center during lunch so parking was a little bit a challenge, that aside.        The place has a nice vibe a little loud but cool.   There are tons of combo and choices so I think it will suit everyone.   Service was friendly and efficient burgers arrived quickly.   The burger were very good and had a good homemade flavor.   The sweet potato fries were a winner as well.     We will definitely be back...."
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,"I'm the vegetarian in the group and we come here often. I've had the kale salad which is huge! I love the impossible vegan burger, the gluten free buns and the atmosphere. If you eat meat- eat farm burger grass fed. It's so much better for you. Try the sweet potato hush puppies! The yummiest appetizer ever."
Farm Burger Huntsville,5,"Stopped at Farm Burger while driving through Huntsville. It reminds me of Five guys /burger Fi with a twist. The patties are larger and tastier, they do charge for additional toppings but they do offer options not found on a Five Guys or Burger Fi menu (I.e. candied jalapeños, blue cheese) and they aren't shy about the quantity. They also serve beer and offer their fries in a few different styles. Malt Vinegar and ketchup at the table as well. If you're in the market for a good burger in a casual setting , give it a shot"
Farm Burger Huntsville,1,"If I could give 0 I would, where to start my hamburger was warm not hot, my fries were just piece not whole,  they packaged my food to go even though I was eating in, the staff are just mean I asked for a receipt and the cashier said no. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
Farm Burger Huntsville,4,"My boyfriend lives in the area and while I was visiting from NY I was anxious to try Farmburger.  I don't eat beef so I had the chicken.  The chicken was freshly made, it was nice & juicy and the fries were tasty.  My boyfriend had the burger and fritters that were actually very good.  I love the decor and the setup of the place is pretty cool.  The staff there is very attentive and the wait for the food wasn't long.The only downside was it was a bit pricey.  We had a burger, chicken sandwich, fritters, fries , 2 drinks and it came to a little under $30.  I'm willing to pay for good food, but nothing about the meal ""wowed"" me.  On another visit we were going to eat here with my boyfriend's daughter, but $45-$50 for a quick meal for 3 is not worth it so we went to Smashburger."
Farm Burger Huntsville,2,"I always come here for the amazing veggie burger but today wasn't the best :/ I asked very nicely if I could get more lettuce and a tomato since it says it comes with it and this is what I got (third pic is after they ""fixed it"")"
House of Kabob,5,"Very friendly staff. We were served by I assume the proprietor based on how she was talking. She gave us an extra soup and also brought my daughter crayons and paper to color. We were also checked on at least three times by another friendly employee.The food was delicious. I had a two kabob combo, chicken and beef, and my wife had a chicken and beef kabob a la carte. The odd thing was that my chicken kabob was chunks of chicken and hers was ground. Both of them were very flavorful, especially with the taziki, but we the menu wasn't clear on what the difference was. I enjoyed the soup very much as well. I could see ordering that soup as a main entree on a winter day, maybe with some pita. The worst I can say is that I wish I had ordered more, as I didn't know what the portion sizes would be, and I wish they had fountain drinks as opposed to cans. Other than that, very positive experience. We will definitely be back."
House of Kabob,4,"We had a wonderful experience here. The staff was attentive and the service excellent.We had the Lentil Soup first. I'm not generally a fan of lentil soup, but theirs was by far the best I've had. There were three of us, we all had it, and we all agreed on this. Slurp, gone!I had the beef and chicken kabob combo, which came with Persian Rice and slices of grilled tomato, green pepper, and chopped onion. The grilling and marinade on the meat was perfection.Of special merit, I must enthuse about their Persian rice--and was certain to compliment it as we were leaving. So many places serve rice that is lifeless and joyless in the mouth; it tastes like it was made by people who have never had good rice. This rice was a delight to the senses. When I complimented them on it, the chef was thrilled because she feels the same way and enthused about the particular virtues of Persian rice for that sensational mouth-feel."
House of Kabob,5,"My first time here and I am absolutely coming back!! As soon as I walked in, I was was welcomed and greeted with a happy smile! The staff in so kind and attentive! It's clean and has a homey feel. THE FOOD IS AMMAZZINNGGG and fresh! If you like lamb I highly recommend the Lamb Kabob meal!! 5 stars for the house of Kabobs!"
House of Kabob,5,"We were visiting from out of town and last night we were looking for someplace to have dinner, unfortunately they were closed. So today we made sure to stop by for lunch before they close. We had the combo kabob platter (chicken and koobideh kabob), lentil soup, and a side of salad. The koobideh kabob was so tender and juicy and paired amazingly with the buttery rice. The lentil soup was also delicious, with a homemade feel. Since everything is fresh and made to order, it did take some time to get our order, but was well worth the wait. The owner seemed very nice and helpful. The food was so good, we just ordered the exact same to go! If you're in the Huntsville area, don't miss out on this small, yet extremely delicious, Persian kabob house. Thanks fellow Yelpers for helping us find this hidden gem."
House of Kabob,5,i highly recommend this place!!! the crew are very friendly and nice. the food was excellent and not expensive! i had lamb and chicken kabob then my husband had lamb kabob and it was really really good! the rice was so tasty!
House of Kabob,5,"Really nice place, kinda lost, but definitely worth it. It looks like they are only open from 10:30a-3pm Tues to Sun. They got me a freshly made pea soup really tasty. Then I got the combo and that was really good. The two ladies are so cute and passionate by their food that you can really taste the love in how they cook and prepare everything. That place should definitely get more credit, because price/quality and quantity is really, really good. Will come back next weekend for sure!!"
House of Kabob,4,"Yummy, extremely fresh Persian food in a tiny building on Sparkman!The service was very warm and friendly and busier themselves making sure we had a lovely visit.  I enjoyed the Persian music piped into the restaurant, too.  Small but cute interior.  It was a little warm in the restaurant, but that's often the case when there's an open kitchen and it's June in Alabama.We ordered the Joojeh (chicken thigh) kabob and the kabob combo - which consisted of one Joojeh kabob and one beef kabob koobideh (ground beef with onions and spices).  We were served complimentary lentil soup, as well.  Even though it was a hot day for soup, we thoroughly enjoyed this special treat.  It had a rich, almost meaty flavor.  Our kabobs were obviously freshly prepared - hot and juicy!  We agreed that we both liked the Joojeh kabob better but the ground beef was also tasty.  The rice serving was plentiful and the rice was perfect - delicate, not clumped up at all, and flavorful all on its own.  The fresh veggies added to the plate were delicious, too, especially the green bell peppers.  The tzatziki sauce was delicious, too - it had a very fresh and ""clean"" taste.  I do wish there had been more, though; and I could have used a few more chicken pieces on the Joojeh plate.We grabbed a baklava to go and split it three ways when we got home.  It was perfectly sticky and crunchy and very reasonably priced for the size.I recommend checking this place out, trying something new, and offering your patronage to some very kind and welcoming folks!P.S. per a phone conversation I overheard, all of the food they serve is halal."
House of Kabob,5,Great little lunch spot. The owner is from Iran and her cooking is fabulous. Also they had authentic Persian tea and deserts. I will definitely be back to this little gem.
House of Kabob,4,"Truly delicious food and very kind service. We got the #1 and #2 combos. They are served with lentil soup, which I think I would love to eat a liter of on a cold day. Excellent flavor on all meat.The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is that it doesn't seem like a good value for cost. The dishes were both mostly rice with a small amount of meat. It felt a little unsatisfying to sit there and eat plain (albeit perfectly cooked!) rice to feel full at the end of the meal."
House of Kabob,5,Excellent soup and kabob! We got the joojeh and it was sooo good. The rice was also nice and fluffy. Doesn't come with bread so I would recommend getting some on the side. Only downside is the location is sketchy but they also deliver!
House of Kabob,5,"This is a very modest appearing place with outstanding food. Nothing fancy, but fresh and flavorful. Recommend Kabat bakhrfari, barley soup and salad shirazi. The proprietor and her helper are very friendly and nice."
House of Kabob,5,"Huntsville is clogged with mediocre chain restaurants and grotesque fast food joints. House of Kabob is seriously an oasis. My husband and I were finally able to get here for a Saturday lunch (the hours are extremely limiting) and it was quite literally the very best meal we've had since moving here last year. We moved here from D.C., where there's a kabob place every few blocks, and the chicken and rice here was as good (or better) than any of the great places we used to eat. It honestly felt like home.The woman who was cooking there could not have possibly been nicer. She was so friendly and brought us complimentary tea and little sampling portions of their saffron rice pudding. I can't possibly recommend this place enough to anyone looking for a homey, healthy, and just generally delightful meal. Stick around and eat there too!"
House of Kabob,5,Delicious little hole in the wall. I had the #1 lamb and chicken and a cup of the lentil soup. Everything was incredibly flavorful!
House of Kabob,5,"One of my favorite spots in town without a doubt! Terrific spiced middle eastern food. I am a sucker for the lamb kabobs. They are fantastic and come accompanied with white rice and other goodies. If ever in Huntsville, don't forget to stop and check out this little place off Sparkman dr. You wouldn't be disappointed."
House of Kabob,5,"This restaurant is amazing. One of the best restaurant in Huntsville. Food is really really delicious, when you go there they have you a free delicious soup. I been a lot and try all the menu. They are so kind"
House of Kabob,5,"Visiting huntsville from NJ and decided to give this place a shot.   I have to be honest and say that my expectations were not high, I was very happy to be proven wrong.  I had the lentil soup and the Kobideh kebab on top of rice.  The lentil soup was fantastic and the kebab was very tender and  very fresh.  The rice was perfectly cooked with great flavor.  The two women that worked there were very nice and helpful.  I will definitely be coming back."
House of Kabob,5,The food was amazing and the service was great too I will definitely be going back very soon for more. I wish they were open for longer because it is hard to go during their business hours. The portion size was perfect in my opinion. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to try Persian food!
House of Kabob,5,"Ordered the #1 and #3 just to cover everything my tastebuds were demanding. Both were delicious, and cooked perfectly. Portion size for one order would have been the perfect amount, ended up sharing the Bakhtiari with co-workers flocking to the smell. Excellent food, excellent service. I will definitely be back. Just watch out for the dip in the road pulling in to the parking lot."
House of Kabob,5,"As I have stated in other reviews I was in Huntsville for business.  We were looking for a nearby highly rated place for lunch...Jackpot!  All I can tell you is that I ordered the #2, chicken and beef kabobs.  This was so good. Even the tea was delicious, had a lot of lime but could not put it down.  After we ordered we sat down and the owner brought over a small bowl of lentil soup.  We did not order or expect this but I was very glad to have this delicious soup.  Then came the entree.  Both kabob were flavorful and came with a sufficient helping of rice.  My colleague and I both commented that we would need to take home what we didn't eat but we both cleaned our place.  Only regret is we didn't take the suggestion to purchase dessert for later."
House of Kabob,5,"Ate here for the first time with friends and returned the following day with my husband. Outstanding! This is not fast food (nor would I consider it slow service), it is quality food. Everything is fresh and delicious! The staff are super friendly and welcoming. This is sure to become a regular stop for us"
Big Oh’s,5,"This place  is amazing! The best Korean food in Huntsville, hands down. Plus the staff is very accommodating , love their service. We got pandemic take out and were pleasantly surprised. The food is authentic and on point!The shrimp pancake appetizer was my favorite . I also got Jap Che which are sweet potato noodles with bulgogi meat, oh it was delicious. My date got the bulgogi platter and ate every last drop! We will return as I'm already craving to come back."
Big Oh’s,5,"Amazing First time dine! I sat right in front of the line cook.Order the Bugolgi Plate!!!! Paired with an ice cold Cass!Mix the soy and gochujang sauce together, youre welcome!"
Big Oh’s,3,"Ok first off, I lived in the ROK for a year while I was in the Army so I know what Korean food should taste like. I hadn't been here before since we both love Korean food me and my date took a chance. First off, it's clearly a mom and pop. Which is awesome! Grumpy Korean chef behind the counter and social and sweet mama san who seats you and takes care of you as the host. The wait staff was young. Of course I'm old so what does that mean anyway? They were very attentive, but I would like to kindly offer the following advice: If you see a couple deeply engaged in conversation and obviously flirting with each other, don't interrupt. If we need you we'll make eye contact or signal or something.I had the hot stone pot bibimbop. bibimbop is one of my favorite all time meals. I used to eat lunch at the Katusa snack bar on Camp Red Cloud, and would have that, kimchi, and coke in a glass bottle (that's right, the only way to really enjoy coke!). As expected, it came in sizzling. Surprisingly however, when I asked the waiter for gachujang sauce he looked confused. Instead he offered a ""red sauce"" which turned out to be a liquidy gachujang. I would recommend to the cook that he make a good pasty gachujang from scratch. Although the house version tasted right, it also appeared to be from a can. In addition, the beef was some kind of ground meat. Generally, I expect marinated and sautéed beef strips, like bulgogi. My date ordered the ramen. The waiter was tuned in enough to know about the various levels of spice and was able to appropriately advise her, which honestly at most restaurants at this level is quite rare. I didn't actually taste it, but it looked they used ramen noodles from a bag. Yeah you know which ones Im talking about. The ones you ate in college because you spent all your money on beer and girls. All in all, I'd say I love mom and pops in general. This one is unique and has a hole-in-the-wall flare that makes me want to come in from the cold and get a hot steaming bowl of something with noodles or rice. Im giving it three stars because the food was Ok. Not great, but priced appropriately. The wait staff was attentive, at some times a little too much so. If I could change anything it would be to use marinated beef strips in the bibimbop and provide kimchi as a standard appetizer (ala I Love Korea on Jordan rd.) Oh, and offer genuine Korean style hot kimchi as an option. Not the watered down stuff most American Korean joints offer."
Big Oh’s,5,Great food amazing spicy ramen and clean and cozy atmosphere . No complains but the alcohol is kinda pricey :(
Big Oh’s,5,I eat here at least once a week.  Bulgoggi plate is my favorite and the Kimchi is very good.   Friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere.  Enjoyable and quick service.
Big Oh’s,5,"Between the above par service and the wonderful food Big Ohs became a quick family favorite.The Bogolgi, Pot stickers, and the adorable chef who always seems to give me more kimchi. I just love it and so does my fiance along with my stepdaughter now too. Right downtown so it is a easy walk to the bars, clubs, big spring park, veterans Park or the VBC. It's perfect for a quick fix and a lovely atmosphere!"
Big Oh’s,5,"Incredible service, nice atmosphere, and the food was excellent. We went for an early dinner and were the only diners. It was so nice!The Yakimandu Dumplings were absurdly good, as other reviewers have noted. I desperately wished there were more than 2 per order. Spicy pork isn't all the spicy (my husband was hoping for more of a kick). I got the ramen (it was a chilly day) and was very pleased. You likely won't have enough for many leftovers, but you'll be glad you went!!"
Big Oh’s,5,I am consistently pleased with Big Oh's. There is nothing that I have ordered that I wouldn't order a second time. The seafood pancakes is the dish that I order most frequently. The serving sizes are generous. The staff is always friendly.
Big Oh’s,5,"Visited this quaint restaurant last night for the first time. So glad we discovered this new eclectic place in downtown Huntsville. Our server, Justin, was such a treat to be around. He made sure everything was tended too in a timely manner. 10/10 would recommend this wonderful k fusion dining."
Big Oh’s,5,Have been living in Huntsville for 9 months and just now trying Big Oh's. Really hate that I've waited so long. I had lunch there today and it was wonderful. I sat at the bar and was able to watch Chef Oh cook my food. Service was top notch and food was even better. I had a half and half order of the specialty wings and the spicy pork lunch special. The wings were crispy and delicious and the pork was perfectly cooked. I will definitely be back in the near future.
Big Oh’s,5,"I liked the food, when you walk in you order first and then you sit down and wait for your order. We both had the beef bulgogi, and the Kimchi rice! I loved both, the food tasted great, food quality food and amazing kimchi- it's a cute place located downtown in the same building where that pizza place was once by Jimmie johns! I say check out this place! I actually plan on going back very soon!"
Big Oh’s,4,A must stop local place in downtown Huntsville next to the court house. nice old building that has outdoor seating. Looks like a place that might get crowded at night during the bar scene. started off with the wings good then had the Korean pork tacos. Hey Korean place that serves burgers wings and Korean food a must.
Big Oh’s,5,Small location with 5 star food and presentation. Look forward to visiting when I go to Huntsville.
Big Oh’s,2,"My family and I had lunch here Saturday after the St. Patrick's Day Parade. I was excited to finally try this place because the last two times we tried, we were turned away due to a lack of seating. My husband ordered bulgogi which came with white rice and a side of soup or salad (he chose soup), I had the shrimp summer rolls, and our two children both ordered chicken fingers and fries. Our lunch cost almost $70 (15% gratuity included)! The service wasn't great; we waited almost an hour for our food. However, the staff was very friendly and attentive. The portions were small. The food tasted ok; it was fresh but wasn't spectacular or exceptional. We really don't mind paying more for a meal but when we do, there are certain expectations. Our visit was disappointing. We will not be returning."
Big Oh’s,5,"This place was a hidden gem.  My friend and I tried this place and it had charm.  We sat at the bottom and watched them cook the food.  The staff was friendly.  We ordered the wings which were meaty and crispy.  It was coated w a great sauce.  The ramen bowl was delicious, the toppings were fresh.  The place was not fancy but people came in and the line was not long.  The menu was good, I will be back to try some more items!"
Big Oh’s,1,"We were very disappointed with the food and the service here. It was our first time trying Big Oh's, and we notified (who we thought was) our server immediately that I don't eat meat, turns out that all of the servers are working the entire restaurant. We shared a vegetable pancake, I ordered a vegetarian bibimbap on the hot stone, and my friend ordered bulgogi beef. First, it took an hour or so to get our entrees, not only was I brought the wrong entree, but they served me dumplings with meat in them. I notified one of the servers that my entree was incorrect, and he just said ""Sorry"" and walked off. I wasn't offered a new entree, a refund, or anything. From what we were able to eat, the food was bland at best. When it was time to pay, the woman at the register asked which meal was mine, and I still got charged for my friend's meal. I paid over $30 for an incorrect meal that I really couldn't even eat. Overpriced, bad service, bland food, would not recommend."
Big Oh’s,5,"So far, the best bulgogi in the area.  Great outdoor seating and prices are decent.  Service is great and attentive."
Big Oh’s,3,"3.5 Stars.  An automatic star reduction for the absence of a changing station in the restroom, my husband is obsessed with having a comfortable spot to change our little one.  Another star reduction for food experience.  3 stars go to the bomb service and live music being played at the adjacent bar, Amendment XXI.This place was previously one of our favorite spots in hsv for Korean food, as meat eaters.  Now that we are vegan, sadly big oh's may not be the best fit for us anymore.  We got spring rolls to start; my husband grimaces at the thought of them.  Cold veggies wrapped in a tasteless cold clear noodle, with the texture similar to melted plastic.  The dipping sauce was pretty good, but it couldn't save those rolls.I ordered my usual ramen, except now without the chicken and cheese, and although the broth is delicious, I felt something was missing with every bite.  My husband ordered the Jap Chae Bap, which had great flavor, but we apparently aren't fans of the glass noodle texture.  I would recommend Big Oh's to a non-vegan any day, but unfortunately we may have to retire this little gem along with our steaks and extra cheesy pizzas."
Big Oh’s,4,One of my favorite downtown lunch spots! The food is so unique from anything else around Huntsville. It is always fresh and service is always quick. Super easy to grab lunch during work and not feel rushed.
Big Oh’s,5,"What a happy surprise walking into Big Oh's while I was in town. As a Los Angeles native, I have been around quality Korean food for my entire life. When I heard there was an awesome Korean restaurant in the middle of Alabama I was skeptical but had to check it out. Straight up the best Kim chi and bulgogi I've ever had. I got the burrito which was pan fried and crispy and perfect. I have heard from multiple people their burger is also incredible and will be back to try it ASAP next time I'm in Huntsville. The staff was also super friendly and checked in frequently to make sure I was topped up on water, which I greatly appreciated in my hungover state. The deserts also looked rad but I was too full to try anything post-burrito. Beer selection is great too, and they have soju! A+ all around here."
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,5,"One of the Best new restaurants inHuntsville. As a restaurant reviewer hands-down this bistro-tapas specialty will be having a hard time keeping pace with demand bc it's that good. From the front door service, creative dishes that perfectly compliment the wine this place will satisfy even the most persnickety astrophysicist! But as a wine lover recently transported from Europe I can breathe easy in knowing ""these guys get it!""Well done, the decor is fun, we started with the Tuscan wine flight and a Belgian beer paired with a meat tray and a red wine cheese tray. Then for dinner the #scallops oh my!!! Really yummy! Then a few pizzas and finished off with decadence for dessert, strawberry cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake  you'll blow your points out the window with a smile on your face! Make reservations- and live music  on Friday night!"
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,3,"This place has a lot of potential but the kinks need working out. Firstly, we had a New Year's Eve 5 pm reservation. So we arrive about 4:55 pm and are forced to stand inside at the door with two other parties for what seemed like an eternity, after the lady behind the bar tells us she'll be right with us. Once we are seated we are practically in the laps of the patrons beside us, who are keenly interested in our food selections as well as our conversation (without our encouragement). After ordering Prosecco, we are told they are out. So I had a glass of champagne.We ordered the two-each option of the fried deviled eggs, beef and pork meatballs, street tacos, and shrimp and Conecuh sausage skewers. They all came out at the same time, which we were not expecting in this type of format (small plates, tapas). The street tacos were the best, followed by the meatballs. The deviled eggs needed a little more ""umph"". The skewers were my least favorite. The shrimp had a mushy consistency. The overall seasoning also needed some pizazz. Lastly, we ordered the scallops served with mixed greens. The sauce accompanying the scallops was good, as was the dressing on the greens. But like the shrimp, the scallops had the same mushy consistency. We ordered the chocolate raspberry cheesecake for dessert  Again, it was just standard, in need of a little punching up. We both agreed that the crust did not have a good flavor. The flavors all depend on one's perception of taste since we all don't taste food the same,  but I didn't feel very satisfied after the meal.Our server (Mallory?) was very patient with us and attentive. The decor and layout of the space gives no suggestion at all to being the former Uncle Maddio's Pizza location. Flight Plan offers a lunch menu as well as the dinner options we mentioned, and more, bnaan bread pizza, salad, and sandwiches. Some items are only available at lunch. Prices are all quite reasonable.The best part of all is that, judiciously, there were no patrons who deemed it appropriate to bring their toddlers or small, misbehaving children with them. This is a sophisticated venue and we need more places like this in our area which maintain this integrity."
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,3,"We stopped by for lunch while in town for business. The food was okay, but not memorable. I ordered the smoked ham and prosciutto sandwich, which came with a side of spicy fries. I suspect that the meals are secondary to the wine, which they seem to have a rather large offering. Maybe if I am in town with my wife someday for dinner we might check it out."
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,5,"My husband & I have been here twice & sooo love this place. The service, the atmosphere, the food & the wine are all Amazing!"
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,5,We had such a lovely time at flight plan. The food and wine were delicious! I highly recommend.
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,2,"The charcuterie was made up of crackers, meat and cheese that were of supermarket quality. The waitress was nice but gave us no status of when food would be served. The tapas dishes were mediocre at best. Avoid shrimp and scallops."
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,5,"My husband and I went here for the first time last week and had a wonderful time! Our server was very helpful and had great suggestions for us. We tried the Spanish cheese and meat medley, Naan Pizza and Flash Fried Spinach. My husband had a flight of Malbecs and I had a great Ferus Artisan IPA. We finished off the meal with the smoked cheesecake at our  server's recommendation and everything we had was unique and delicious. We can't wait to go back and are so happy they are here in South HSV :)"
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,5,What a great new place. Friendly service extensive beer and wine selection and nicely decorated. We are up from Orlando visiting relatives and would love to transplant this place to our area. Sláinte guys and thank you.  Meet the chef nice to have pride in your work.
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,1,"Went in on Saturday looking to support the new establishment. Selected a bottle of wine and then could not figure out who or where to pay. To make it more difficult, a large group was taking pictures and blocking most of the path to the back, where I may have found a place to pay. Anyway, I stood there for a period of time, waiting for some assistance and for the group to complete their photo session. At some point I realized there was no help coming and the photo gang wasn't going to be speedy and didn't realize or care about my odd predicament. The management has a bit of work to do to get the place organized and figure out how to serve their potential customers. I doubt I'll be back anytime soon as Mary's grocery has a great selection and super service."
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,5,"Great new wine and tapas bar in South Huntsville. All of small plates and small bites that we ordered were delicious. Wine flights were fantastic. It was a busy Friday night, but the service was still top notch, which surprised me since they are still new. The smoked cheesecake was amazing! The live music was good, but pretty loud for the type of venue."
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,4,"This place is very trendy on the inside, nicely decorated and while I sat at a table, the lounge and bar both looked very welcoming. Wine flight possibilities are listed on the menu with quite a few possibilities, but I do wish you could customize your own flight. We split 3 plates; fried deviled eggs were very interesting and tasty, meatballs were the absolute star of the show, I'd skip the fried green tomatoes. Pork belly for the tomatoes was great but it seemed like the tomatoes didn't get cooked all the way during the frying process and were tough. They don't offer some items during dinner so we'll be back to try their lunch sandwiches"
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,5,Just the thing Huntsville needed (and such a clever name for the area). I got the Buon Vino Roso wine flight and it was amazing! So worth the ~$13 to try those four wines.  It equaled about the amount you'd get in two glasses of wine. I haven't gone for food yet but I can't wait to try it! I've heard great things about their food already.
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,5,Awesome food great service great paring s  please do yourself a favor and visit this new wonderful place in south Huntsville. We so need them to stay
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,5,I've been here once for lunch and twice for dinner  now. It's amazing. It's one of my favorite restaurants in Huntsville. My two favorite dishes are the scallops and the bacon wrapped dates. My husband and I have been to NOLA and had bacon wrapped dates that we thought were amazing but these by far surpass those. Honestly one of the best things I've  ever had. The owner is so friendly and you can tell she takes pride in her restaurant. I will come back to this place over and over for the food and the hospitality. I'm so glad to have Flight Plan in Jones Valley!
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,5,"My family and I had a wonderful time here tonight and only wish it was closer to our hometown! The owners are incredibly knowledgeable and will make wonderful recommendations for wine or food. The fried deviled eggs are phenomenal along with the bacon wrapped dates. Our party ordered meatballs, scallops, fried green tomatoes topped with pork belly, and street tacos. The hardest part was deciding on our favorite plate! Our  entire experience was wonderful, from the aesthetic, to the great hospitality, and the incredible food and wine in between. This restaurant is unlike anywhere I've ever been and I will absolutely return next time I am in town."
Flight Plan Wine and Tapas,5,"This place is great. Excellent wine, great ambience, and very nice people. I did a flight of wine and my wife bought a glass, and we were very pleased. The chocolate flourless cake was decadent, and my wife now wants to have sex."
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,5,"I'm visiting here from nyc, which means I'm the local princess of pizza. This pizza was so yummy and the service was awesome. I love this place. Definitely goes on my Huntsville favorites list"
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,3,"We visited Earth and Stone last weekend for a birthday dinner.  I'd been wanting to try this place -- and now I have.  My overall opinion is that it's just decent.It was extremely crowded on a Saturday night.  They don't take reservations, so be prepared to stand around and swoop down on whichever table you want.  The place smells like beer and pizza, which is to be expected (though my personal tastes call for lighter beer smell, ideally).  Our large party ordered their newly available hot wings, the pretzels, pepperoni pizza, the chicken pesto pizza, and the Greene Street pizza.  I managed a nibble of everything except the wings and pretzels.  I was told the wings were okay and the pretzels were quite good.I'll be honest -- I didn't get the tab, so I didn't realize how expensive it all was until I looked it up later.  But the larger size pizza (there are two sizes available, 10 and 14 inch) is 18-21 bucks, depending on the flavor.  And if you come with a big appetite, it's not really THAT difficult to split a large pizza between two or three people (mainly because the crust is super thin and doesn't blow up in your gut, lol).  So I'm guessing the experience was pricy! You order at the counter, are given a buzzer, and then return to pick your food up at the counter.  Place is so crowded that table service is NOT feasible, which is fine, though again, expensive for no table service.The pizza was just...eh.  Toppings weren't distributed super evenly, the pepperoni was greasy even as pepperoni goes, the chicken pesto was a little funky tasting, and while I was really looking forward to the Greene Street, I actually thought it was overloaded with toppings, which  made it get soggy and floppy really quickly.  The pepperoni was my favorite  -- good amounts of cheese and pepperoni, crispy crust, not too much sauce.  Just dab the grease off and it's fine.Overall, probably not worth the high price and huge crowds, but I'd return if a friend wanted to go.  Pizza is hard to mess up too much, and it's good enough here."
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,4,"In general, this is a good fast-casual food stop. The caprese salad is a really yummy way to start and is generous with the mozzarella. We've tried The Porkalicious, The Favorite, and The Chicken Pesto. The Chicken Pesto was bland, but the others were pretty good. Service has been friendly both times we've visited.Surprisingly, the real standout is the ice cream. It's the most reasonably priced AND the most delicious thing we tried. The scoops are huge: 2 scoops = 1 pint. We tried carrot cake, moonrock, and german chocolate. We only wished the german chocolate had been more chocolate-y.The menu would be much improved with some more variation, as most of the pizzas are a variation on ""a lot of meat"". That's why we tried the pesto, which we unanimously agreed was not a winner. I think that prices are too high by about $2/pizza; we paid the same or less for some really standout pizzas at similar places in Atlanta. For me, it's a 3.5/5 stars."
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,5,The place was packed on a Friday night and we were still able to order and get our food within 15 mins. Very impressed. My son loveddddd the pizza.
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,3,"Food is tasty but a little on the pricey side for the size of the pizza you get. Employees were friendly, but the line moves very slowly."
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,4,"My friend and I came to grab some quick lunch and really enjoyed it here! We went there around 3ish and it was not that busy. People trickled in afterwards, but the food was fast and made deliciously. We ordered the Tommy G pizza as it was recommended by many before. Half of it was ordered with no meats and we really enjoyed it! It was fresh and tasty. We shared the 14 inch and we still had leftovers. The staff was also very friendly and knowledgeable on the cuisine. We were surprised by their ability to name everything in the pizzas and were treated with the utmost customer service. I will definitely be coming back to try other of their veggie pizzas as well as their dessert options!"
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,2,"Gave it 2 stars cause it did actually taste good and service was good.But it's like a ton of money for what taste like a pizza you'd get when you take your family to a neighborhood swimming pool.  We got 2 larges and a meatball sub, the larges are seriously like a little frozen California pizza kitchen pizza you'd buy at Publix.  The calzone was good but was 14! Dollars and it was average size at best should be around 7 bucks.  Plus the entire place smells like stale beer my daughter was begging me to leave.  All in all the food was ok though, just certainly not a place to take your kids to"
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,5,"YUM.I was visiting Huntsville - my parents live there - and we stopped by to grab some noms and a beer from the place attached to it. We actually ended up ordering two salads - the Italian and a caesar - as well as  a pizza. The name of the pizza alludes me and it doesn't appear to be on their printed menu, but it was basically a ton of meat, no red sauce, and some arugula. First of all - the salads were amazing. The caesar was a normal caesar, but I could have eaten the Italian all day long. I've actually tried to recreate it at home and I can honestly say it's just not the same.The pizza was also really good. Four of us split a large one (between that and the salads we were good) and it was great! I'm not a huge meat eater, but I was outnumbered, so I picked a lot of the meat off, but I still liked it. The crust is on the thinner side and I'd love to go back and try a pizza with marinara on it (I love red sauce), but I was super pleased.We also ended up ordering some adult ice creams - Captain Carrot Cake, Bourbon Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, and Irish Cream. All were amazing. Highly recommend!!The service was fabulous. Honestly, my entire experience was fabulous."
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,2,"That was disgustingly expensive.  I feel like the butt of a joke.  I would have gotten more bang for my buck if I paid someone the same amount to kick me in the shins.  Frankly, I should have gone to Dominos."
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,3,"Vibrant place on a Wednesday night. Lots of folks outside playing on the lawn and dining on the picnic tables. Basically a large beer hall with a pizza joint in the back. The pizza was tasty but I was disappointed in that it sat out on a counter for a long time; apparently the forgot to activate my buzzer. Probably would have been a lot more enjoyable hot out of the oven.I ordered a small salad with balsamic vinaigrette. As I poured the dressing out of the little black plastic cup, I realized it was only vinegar. When I brought this to the attention of one of the counter folks, they said that's what they have. ??   A little education is in order ...Not a bad experience. I'd probably visit again. I think mgmt needs to cover some basics with the staff."
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,4,"This is part of the inventive Campus 805, a middle school that got converted into a row of bars, breweries, restaurants, and shops.  The pizza here is legit - they use 00 flour and everything.  Combinations were good and they put a decent amount of toppings on the pizzas, which are pretty thin crust due to being charred in the wood-fired oven for a short amount of time.  That crust was excellent, as was the build-your-own pizza we put together.  Cheesy bread was good too, and I'm glad we asked for extra marinara to go with it.  I have to deduct a star because we went back and got dessert later, and while the German chocolate ice cream was quite good, apparently the bourbon bacon one was a definite miss.  It was all bacon and no sweetness, so between that and the small qualm of not being able to order your food and your Yellowhammer beer from the bar next door on the same tab, we arrive at four stars.  Still very good all told, and I'd definitely come back for the pizza again."
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,5,"Should've named this joint Heaven on Earth Pizzas because mmhmm! To quote our son ""I bet this is how they make it in Rome."" You damn right son! Thin crust fired to a perfect crisp but still chewy (miracle yes?) We had the Porkhammer with bacon, Italian sausage and peperoni. My son and I also shared a scoop of the homemade vanilla ice cream. If he hadn't just played his heart out on the soccer field today, I would've hogged it all for myself. Would definitely recommend coming here!"
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,5,"My favorite pizza in town. The crust is so thin, me and a friend can usually eat a full large size pizza. I like the Green Street pizza the best; its covered in vegetables. The service isn't too slow even when there is a long line. The atmosphere in and outside the restaurant is comfortable. Always nice to have Yellowhammer right next door to grab a beer to enjoy my pizza with."
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,4,Hands down best pizza in town. Developed a massive following as a local food truck which pushed the local owners to open their first brick and mortar. If it weren't for Earth and Stone Huntsvillians would be out of luck on the pizza scene. Hand made crust and fresh ingredients cooked in an authentic wood fired pizza oven. Delicious! Don't miss their ice cream either! All flavors made in house.
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,5,"Wonderful, wood-fired vegetarian pizzas here with terrific service. They even offer adult ice creams!  Great experience; great food.  Plus, we were impressed that the manager stopped by our table to make sure we were happy with the food and tell us about other offerings."
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,4,"Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza was a great place to grab a quick dinner. The pizza was pretty dang good and the atmosphere was spectacular. The partnership with Yellowhammer made the experience even better. The restaurant is located in a utilitarian development that is perfectly Spartan. You walk up to the counter and order your pizza, which is then served to you on a piece of butcher paper (who needs plates right?). While you wait you can walk 20 ft through the wall and order a beer at Yellowhammer. The hustle and bustle of both establishments makes for a very energetic environment that is very enjoyable as you socialize at shared tables and enjoy your pizza and beer.The pizza is pretty good. The crust is crispy and chewy, while the sauce and toppings over a great flavor. The wood fire gives such a good smoky taste to everything. The pizza we ordered end up coming up a little burnt. This was recognized by the cooks and they started a replacement pizza for us before even delivering the first pizza for us to eat while we wait for the new one. That's the kind of service that promotes devoted customers. Even with the slightly burned crust, it was still a great 'za."
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,5,Love the yellowhammer brewery and the pizza they serve in Earth and Stone. The cheesy bread goes great with their selection of brews. We also loved the pretzel. I tried the Latham pizza and wasn't crazy about it but that's personal preference. Roasted sweet potatoes and carmelized onion with goat cheese sounded good but was not great IRL. Didn't really taste like a pizza.  Decor is great - love the tables and it's very clean. Good family spot too
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,3,Pizza should have been better. Wood fired and specialty ovens but it was just okay. To be fair I'm originally from New York so the bar is higher when it comes to pizza and with said I've had better artisan pizza in Phoenix Know it was not bad but not up to the hype of the 4.5 stars
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,3,"Good pizza place reasonably priced with a selection of local and unusual beers. Perhaps aimed at a younger demographic, it was sort of a craft beer place with unusual beers while a sports bar ('Bama was beating up another helpless team). Felt as out of place as the team on the Bryant-Denny field...and as a UW grad, about S welcome. Glad I went, if nothing else for experiencing Bama football in Alabama. They sure take it seriously!"
Earth and Stone Wood Fired Pizza,2,"Guess I missed the hipster train because I do not get why people love this place. Part of a group of 9 I got the PMS pizza for everyone to nibble on. With tip(and why am I tipping it's not table service) the total was like 23.00 for a large pizza. I think it had 8 slices. You have to ask for thin metal disc plates and the wax paper liners to out on top of the plates and cart all your stuff (hot pepper sprinkles, forks, salt, pepper) to the adjacent yellow hammer craft beer joint if that's where you are going to dine. Thin crust check. Sauce nothing special and the toppings were erratic, not spread evenly but the quality of the P (pepperoni) M (shrooms) and S (sausage) was good.  Not a value. One in our group ordered one to eat himself because the large is small. I could understand charging these proceed at bridge Street. But not at campus 805. Pieology is just as good and quicker and cheaper. Like I said I get that I'm not a hipster so maybe that's what the missing link is. I hope our next off site is somewhere without craft beer (no bearing on this review) and away from 805 (no bearing on this review)."
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,"This place came highly recommended from our local colleagues that work in the Mobile office.  I walked in and was greeted by a very friendly lady who gave us several choices of where to sit, one of which was the bar.  The place had a good lunch crowd so we grabbed 2 seats at the bar.We must've looked like we wanted advice on food because another customer instantly suggested the pork chop sandwich. She was about to get a to go order of two of the same.I ordered what was suggested, the pork chop sandwich with skinny fries and my colleague got the Cadillac burger with skinny fries.While we waited the bartender struck up a conversation with us and we had a nice chat with her about our travels, work and Mardi Gras.The atmosphere in the restaurant was very warm and inviting and both the customers and the staff were very friendly.When our food arrived we both ate our sandwiches and I ate all my french fries as well as my colleagues fries.Two satisfied out of towners that will definitely both put this on their favorites of Mobile!! Thanks"
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,4,"Food was solid, a couple of seafood alternatives, taste was pretty good, good-quality overall, I noticed. Is it supremely outstanding when you account for a couple other Mobile offerings in the aree? Probably not. But one thing is for pretty-close-to-certaIn, it won't underdeliver. I was satisfied.This one's a #recommend for now."
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,4,"The food was pretty good. BIL enjoyed the Hot Chicken Sandwich (he added cheese), and Husband enjoyed the Viper Burger. We had some mishaps, though. The Viper Burger was to be made without red tomato (the grilled green tomato was fine), no cheese, no burger sauce (only Viper BBQ sauce), yet the plate came out with everything on it. I ordered my ""Cadillac"" Burger with onions on the side (I don't like onions), but they were piled on the burger and I didn't know until I started eating. But the beignets to finish the meal were superb! I had never had a beignet before, and this was an excellent experience to seeing what they were all about.If I come back, it'll be to try the Hot Chicken Sandwich or maybe the Shrimp Po'Boy. The food took a little while to come out, but the service was good. Give 'em a try or come on back, it's worth the visit!"
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,"Very solid place for lunch. Very fair prices. Wonderful atmosphere and service. I had the Power Poke Bowl. Great flavors and combination of texture between the fish, kale, and quinoa. Had the perfect amount of spice. I also tried their fries and they were some of the best I've ever had. Thin and crispy without being too salty. Will be back for sure!"
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,3,"Came here under the suggestion of  several people saying that this place was a must try. I had high hopes... We were able to order several items from the menu, but nothing really wowed us. Food was mediocre at best. The calamari and steamed mussels are probably the only items I would order again if I came back. The seafood pasta and paella fritters were okay. The fish and chips and the steak frites were underwhelming. The fish was bland and the steak seasoning was overpowering and not very complimentary. The tuna nachos was a bust for the price, pass on that. The drinks were good and our server was great which is why I gave an extra star."
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,"I waited a bit after Squid Ink opened before I tried it out - and now I wish that I went a lot sooner!Downtown Mobile already has several high-quality restaurants, but Squid Ink does a fantastic job to stand out.  Its dishes and flavors are very different from the other downtown restaurants.  I tried the Deviled Eggs, Street Cauliflower, Cadillac Burger, and Steak & Frites.  Each were very unique and extremely delicious.  The Street Cauliflower may not be for everyone, as it is lime and chili-powder infused, but everything else is certainly for everyone.  I think anyone can find a burger for them at Squid Ink, and the Steak & Frites was one of the best meals that I've had in quite awhile.Also, the inside is clean and trendy.  The waitress was very nice and speedy; it felt like the food came out instantly.  I also asked for extra burger toppings and they added them with no extra charge.  Nice!"
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,4,"In town for a training event and got some GREAT intel from a local Yelp Elite on various places to try - and this was one of them! Stopped in for lunch - intrigued both by the name and by memories of a beautiful Squid Ink Tagliatelle at Domenica's in New Orleans. SO GLAD I did....Our server - the lovely Chrissy - gave us some background on the establishment and how it got its name and then took great care of us throughout the meal. Would come back JUST for that reason. Great atmosphere with a nice industrial/farm vibe, centrally located in the downtown area. Ate at the bar which offered a nice selection of spirits as well as a decent variety of beers including some local fan favorites. I had the Fish and Chips with Skinny Fries and a White Claw Black Cherry to wash it down. The fish of the day was Yellow Tail and it was generously portioned and deliciously prepared, accompanied by a very nice aioli whose exact ingredients currently escape me BUT IT WORKED. That's the main bit. Looks like they have a nice happy hour promising - among other things - fried Deviled Eggs - which sounds heavenly.....Put this on your ""must do"" list when you're in town......"
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,"Will be back! I've been wanting to try Squid Ink since they opened and I finally had the chance so I pounced! We came by briefly for a cocktail and appetizer and both were great. We opted for the ""Street Cauliflower"" (see pic) appetizer, which was a $5 happy hour appetizer today, and it was absolutely delicious and absolutely not a ""heavy"" appetizer. This is one you can have a few drinks with and not feel bloated!Staff was great and friendly. Decor is very much to my liking with interior brick, rout iron, wood and eclectic fixtures. I can't wait to come back and order more from the menu.Great drinks. Great staff. Great menu selection!"
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,My new favorite restaurant in Mobile. I'm not sure what else to say.  I heard so many good things from everyone else I had to go try it myself.  Yum yum yum.  3 Yums is equivalent to 5 stars ya know. The CadillacBurger is the best in Mobile at the moment in my own personal opinion. And I have been looking.  Fresh hand packed burger patty with some bacon that freaking amazing by itself.  Fries are strings of perfection.  I look forward to returning.
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,"A solid 4.5 for me! I usually wait on grand opening reviews as there are typically a million kinks to factor in. Not at Squid Ink. Hubs and I stopped in and thoroughly enjoy our first visit. We ordered the deviled eggs (EGGS-ellent!), street cauliflower (my personal fave), avocado toast (also my fave), and the fish and chips (also my fave- that aioli is everything)-- YAASSSSS! All were so tasty. Not one of those menu items was a miss! The decor is cute and and I love what they've done with the place! Katie, our server and bartender, was super attentive and made our drinks with care! My only critique would be a minor drink issue. I'm a Pisco Sour lover, like obsessed, so when I saw it on the menu, I was thrilled. To my surprise, it's made with no egg whites. So I was a bit thrown off. I won't order it again, but there are plenty of other drink options that I'm looking forward to trying out. Hubby says that his Old Fashioned was spot on, and we both loved that they have sphere ice cubes! Check out the new kid on the block! I'm sure you'll enjoy it!"
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,3,This is a interesting new spot in town.  Went for lunch with a very limited menu.  Surprisingly limited being in a high lunch traffic area.  Makes me wonder how often the menu will change?On this visit I had the avocado toast which was perfectly cooked and presented.  Others at the table had shrimp poboys which they said were good but too large to be able to eat on the bun.The place has a interesting vibe with balcony seating indoor. I'm actually excited to come back for happy hour to try more of this interesting menu.
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,"Stumbled in here with a coworker and SO glad I did!  Staff is very friendly, the place has a cool and casual feel, and garage-inspired decor. The drink menu is very creative though they are still working out the flavors. The food is BOMB! I had the catfish sandwich (which sounds fine on the menu) and the shoestring fries and I was blown away by the first bite. The fish was moist, well seasoned, and at a perfect temperature. The bun was soft, buttery, and melded perfectly into the fish. It was dressed so well with a super tasty remoulade and fresh lettuce and tomatoes. The fries are thin, crispy, and perfectly seasoned. They aren't too salty at all but they are crazy addictive. Even the pickle was super solid. Next time I'm going to try the cauliflower appetizer (which looks similar to elote) and the calamari. Awesome addition to downtown!"
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,Great spot for lunch. The decor is very cool with mobile facts and Information. They have a very cool loft that overlooks the restaurant and bar area. I had the shrimp P.O. Boy....not sure why my phone keeps correcting it to P.O. bUt anyway...   ;) it was great! My wife got the Mob Town hot chicken. Both were great portions and a plate full of fresh crispy fries. Very trendy vibe. It appears they had a variety of mixed drinks and beers. We didn't get to try any on this visit but we will next time.
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,4,"The table was sticky, the music was a little too loud, but by golly was our waiter friendly! In town for a conference, many places were stuffed with conference attendees, so I'm glad there was a perfectly-sized table for my colleagues and me. Two of us don't eat much in the way of seafood or mammal, and this was one of the few nearby dinner places that we saw had chicken meals on the menu. I ordered the Mob Town chicken sandwich, which was spicy enough to burn my lips, but wasn't too hot overall. It had good flavor too. I also really enjoyed my refreshing Pimm's Cup, which I so rarely find on menus in the U.S.! From the varietal menu to the decor of Cadillac hubcaps, a bobblehead collection, and a Japanese mural, this restaurant is eclectic, as its logo states, but every individual from most groups will be able to find something they like about it. One note: walk in, grab a menu, then grab a table. A waiter will find you."
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,"This place has the coolest vibe and the most delicious, interesting food! We were just snacking, so we split a couple of apps, but I can't wait to go back. The tuna nachos are so very tasty. Do NOT leave without trying the street cauliflower! I don't even like cauliflower, but this was AMAZING: roasted cauliflower topped with cojita cheese, cilantro, and lime. All the flavors just work perfectly. Party in your mouth."
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,4,"We tried Squid Ink based on its menu, and it delivered! Of the appetizers, our group of 4 shared the avocado toast, paella fritters, fried deviled eggs, and street cauliflower. Cauliflower is not something I would normally order for an appetizer, but it was my favorite. Our major complaint was that the kitchen was very quick in sending out our food, but the bar was not. We waited lengthy times to get drinks when our food was already finished. If they could get those two things on the same page, this would be a five star review."
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,"After mindlessly scrolling through restaurant after restaurant - most of which I've already tried before - I stumbled upon Squid Ink. It was new and trendy and looked like just the place my husband and I would like to start our night.When we got there, we were seated quickly despite the crowd. The interior is somewhat low-lighted and decorated by fun little trinkets that add to the atmosphere. I particularly enjoyed the ""waving cat"" in the hole above the bar! We started off with a seasonal cocktail - the Mistletoe Mule. Delicious! We ordered the Street Cauliflower as our appetizer. A few of the first bites seemed overly seasoned, but otherwise this was a light and tasty appetizer to begin our meal with.I ordered the Tuna Poke Bowl (watch out - it is spicy!) and the hubs ordered the Southern Viper burger. I throughly enjoyed my tuna bowl. SO good! I didn't try the burger, but judging by how fast it disappeared from my husband's plate, I'd say it must've been great.What was most impressive to me was how quickly everything, including the entrees, were served. Service was exceptional, the atmosphere was awesome, and the food was so good! Prices are great, too! It was refreshing to try something new and different. We will be back!"
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,"First time. Service was impeccable. Food was very tasty, fresh, and innovative. If PaninI Pete is behind it, I'm in!"
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,"Thanks to Juliet, our YELP ambassador for telling us about Squid Ink!  My husband and I had eaten here when it was Panni Pete's and knew I wanted to try SI when I learned that Pete was the owner of this new restaurant.  We chose to sit upstairs and what a great view of the restaurant with a smaller area tucked away from the crowd.  We started off with strawberry margaritas.  We both wanted to try 2 menu items so we decided to order the Mob Town hot chicken sandwich and the Cadillac hamburger.  They both come with the skinny fries which were fried perfectly.  A side of ranch dressing for me for the fries.  My husband and I switched out 1/2 of our entrees so we could try both.  Both were delicious, however, my favorite was the burger."
Squid Ink Eclectic Eats & Drinks,5,The place is one of the newer pop ups in downtown Mobile.  The burgers alone are worth stopping in for.
The Noble South,5,Was looking for a safe place to pick up food during this pandemic - definitely a safe place to go with the staff wearing PPE.  Great place to pick up good if you like unique dishes with local ingredients.
The Noble South,5,Probably the best catfish in Mobile. Lunch menu has meat and three style and somewhat affordable. Everything I've had from here has been great.
The Noble South,4,"Not the greatest Farm-2-Table restaurant I've eaten at, but it had a quaint atmosphere and good service. Out of the two dishes ordered, one was amazing and the other was dry and average. Dessert was a memorable fig cake. If you've got extra cash, I would recommend eating there for a nice dinner out. Otherwise, I'd say it's hit or miss depending on the dish."
The Noble South,5,"I went there for lunch yesterday, ordered blue cheese jelly wipes bread for the app, cheese sandwich, and crab omelet for the meal, goat cheesecake for dessert.Except One spot on the bottom of the omelet has too much salt and taste salty. Everything else great. I would not give any one start bc of one single factor. Flavor 5 Value 5Service 5"
The Noble South,5,"Can I say WOW!! Just passing through this small town and I can't believe the caliber of cooking they have here! Everything was beyond delicious, perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked. Had the blueberry wings, chicken pate, deviled eggs, shrimp & grits & pecan pie. Plus the cocktails were top notch : we had just passing through & ruby the riveter. Overall don't miss the opportunity of eating at this place!"
The Noble South,5,"I absolutely love this place! It has a wonderful cozy but modern feel. The decor is rustic but it's all very clean and sleek. The cocktails are excellent, featuring unique flavors like molé bitters and cardamom syrup. The staff is wonderfully friendly, as well, and very eager to make recommendations and accommodations. I love that they do a prix fix Meatless Monday menu (and sometimes it's vegan!). They also have a blackboard prominently featuring produce from local farms, which is so awesokThe food here is creative and delicious. I've never had anything bad, but the fish is always excellent. The skin is always crispy and the fish tender and well seasoned. The sides (like eggplant fritters and duck egg fried rice) are creative and delightful. Highly recommend this spot for an elevated yet casual experience in downtown Mobile."
The Noble South,3,"Had a quick lunch here. Ordered a deviled egg and a plate lunch with pork chop, LA caviar (beans), brussel sprouts and lobster gumbo. Deviled eggs, beans and gumbo tasted standard. Pork chop was grilled perfectly, the fat melting in the mouth while the meat remained juicy with crispy skin. Bruseel sprouts were seasoned nicely, but a bit too oily. The main dining room was crowded so we were assigned to a smaller room at next door, but there appeared to be only one server taking care of the whole room, so service was a bit slow."
The Noble South,5,"I was staying alone in Mobile for the night, and I wanted somewhere with great food to have a dinner alone. The Noble South provided a cozy and comfortable experience with a dinner to remember! Upon arriving, the restaurant was busy, yet had some bar seating available. I sat at the bar and had a glass of Rose. I was having a hard time deciding between the steak and quail, but the bartender recommended the quail, because she said it was a very unique dish. I'm 100% happy with my choice, because the quail may have been the best dish I've ever eaten. The bird came prepared with creamed corn and delicious spices. It was simply amazing!!! Words can't even describe how wonderful my dinner was. The other thing I appreciated was the service and kindness of the bartender and manager. Some restaurants seem to turn their noses up to someone dining alone, but the staff was kind and attentive! This is a great place to dine solo, which can be hard to come by. If I lived near Mobile, I would go back to The Noble South to try their other dishes and ultimately get that quail again. If you're contemplating going here, you should go- you won't regret it!"
The Noble South,5,Sorry...played wiped clean. Get an order of bread ($1). You will want to sop up the plate. Got the pork chop and the lamb belly. Both perfect. Pecan tart fantastic as well. Very happy hospitality experts
The Noble South,5,"This place is a must if you are in downtown Mobile. Parking is a bugger, but worth it. Located in an old restored building on Dauphin Street along with lots of other great shops, bars, and restaurants this place is wonderful. I started with a Bloody Mary very good woke me up! The deviled eggs were delicious with LA caviar, salty and rich. My husband and I both chose plate lunches with two sides. Myself the chicken thighs Mac and cheese and collard greens. My husband the catfish, soup of the day and Mac and cheese. Everything was wonderful. The collard greens were delicious, tangy and rich with ham flavor. Loved the soup as well. Sausage, kale, and potato delicious! Appetizer, drink, 2 meals $40.70."
The Noble South,5,"I picked this place because of the reviews and I'm glad i did. This place has a nice rustic feel to it and the decor has the same vibe. Perfectly located restaurant near the convention center and downtown. From my visit today majority of the customers, are from passerby's and a few are loyal customers. I recommend you swing on by and grab a bite to eat. The sausage balls and pickles were good and the steak and eggs were cooked to perfection. They have the right amount of waitress and tables so you're not waiting too long to order.Overall a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant. I will come again and try to lunch menu."
The Noble South,5,"Downtown Mobile has so many great restaurants, and The Noble South is one of them!  The restaurant has a delightful and chic interior, which incorporates the design of the building's old wood and brick into a stylish dining area.  It is a really nice place to go for a date night, which is why my wife and I went there on Valentines Day.The food may be even better than the resturant's design, though!  If you are into deviled eggs, you got to try the Noble South's with bacon and roe.  We also really enjoyed the pepper jelly, which is served on top of a brie-like cheese (I don't know my cheeses, so I am doing my best to describe it).  I got the grouper (which was fantastic), and my wife got the duck two ways (which was also fantastic).  They also serve steaks, pasta, and many other types of meals.  The Noble South constantly delivers on their dishes, which is why I come here often."
The Noble South,5,Best veggies in Mobile. Get a veggie plate. Brussels were roasted and vinegary with walnuts and red onion. Greens are Smokey and not too oily. Rotating selections are always great. Pickled shrimp app is always good and smoked tuna with eggplant tapenade are good too.
The Noble South,5,Wow.  Great deviled eggs appetizer. The ten dollar lunch special was really good. Paige provided fantastic service. I got catfish and soup. It was really good. I would go back. I might go back for dinner.
The Noble South,5,"I've been to The Noble South a few times and definitely enjoyed it. But tonight I went for their Culinary Costume event where they served a special menu focusing on Vietnamese dishes. I feel like a lot of the Vietnamese food I've been served in restaurants can be too salty, but this was perfectly seasoned. Everything had a wonderful flavor, without giving me a sodium overdose. For starters, we tried the shrimp cakes and carrots. The shrimp cakes were unique with tofu skin and unlike anything I've had before - delicious! Carrots were great. They were served with a peanut sauce - I preferred mine without the sauce but my friend really liked it. There was nothing wrong with the sauce, just my personal preference. I also tried the pho, and again, was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too salty! The bowl was $15 but it was enough for two, or plenty to just have as your meal. For the entrée, I had the fried catfish with rice noodles in a coconut broth. Never would I have imagined that as a good combination, but wow. We tried both desserts on the menu - banana cake and coconut tapioca pudding. To me, banana and coconut are both ingredients that tend to overpower a dish. Both desserts were perfectly balanced. The cake didn't have an overwhelming banana taste, and the same can be said for the coconut in the pudding. But my favorite part of dessert was the tamarind ice cream that was served with the banana cake. I need this to stay in my life! Unfortunately this was a limited event menu that was only served for three nights, but even still, you need to eat here!!! The chef has knack for creating unexpected flavor combinations that work so well together. You can't go wrong with the vegetable plate where you can choose four sides for something like $10 on the lunch menu. That's on their regular menu...I like the kale salad and field peas."
The Noble South,4,"A pretty nice lunch. The meatloaf is very good. The brussel sprouts were over cooked, and overall a little too much salt. The atmosphere is nice and they have outside tables. The portion sizes are fair. The service was good. Price point is fair for a downtown lunch  . This was my first visit."
The Noble South,5,"The Noble South was a great find! We love coming to Mobile to visit and eat at local restaurants. The drink menu was creative and delicious. They had a twist on a French 75 (a French 76) that was great. We ordered a pepper jelly app, the shrimp and grits, and the steak. Everything was well prepared and worth the visit! Friends recommended this place and we would definitely return."
The Noble South,5,"The best meal we have ever had in Mobile. Excellent service combined with top notch farm to table dishes had us planning our next visit while still sitting in the restaurant. Our server Ashley was so warm and welcoming. She had great recommendations and wine suggestions. We will definitely request her as our server on our next visit. The pickled shrimp were a great starter and left us wanting more. We chose the swordfish with sweet potato gnocchi and collard greens and the redfish as our entrees. Oh boy, heaven! For dessert, banana pudding and pecan tart. I can't even deal with the deliciousness. It was the total package for sure and we can't wait to go back. For our next trick, Brunch!"
The Noble South,5,"I literally love this place. I find reasons to be here often. Emily and Taylor are my absolute favorites, and always (without fail) give THE best service! The menu is innovative and offers quite the range for palate preferences with a southern spin. What's more... they have a killer, crafty Pisco Sour. (My FAVE!) Their brunch is delicious and they do a mean Benedict! I can't rave enough! Friendly service-- check, great food & beverage, cute aesthetic, great atmosphere, and takes Open Table reservations... Count me all the way IN!"
The Noble South,5,We came in to The Noble South recently for brunch. The food was delicious! The biscuits are some of the best I have ever tasted! I loved the drinks and the ambiance. Very impressed and will be back soon.
SOCU,5,"Mobile, AL is my childhood home which I visit quite often. Ever since SOCU's Grand Opening, I have stopped in for dinner when I am in town. Everything on their menu is delicious. I have tried their lobster deviled eggs, old town road shrimp and several of their entrees. My go to entree is their fried catfish which I pair with their seafood dressing and mac n cheese. I have never had a bad experience here and their service has always exceeded my expectation. I am looking forward to trying their brunch soon."
SOCU,2,"My husband and I went to SOCU last Sat night, this was our second visit.  Noticed the bar wasn't full (two other couples) so we sat there hoping for faster service.  We had to flag the bartender to get the first drink.  We also ordered our food then as well.  Ordered Coste Petral Prsecco but he brought out LaMarca without asking (I didn't say anything because I like LaMarca but should have been told). After sitting there for a while we needed another drink but were never ask and finally flagged him down again to request a 2nd drink.  We also ask for a water.  After 55 min our appetizers finally made it out.   We ordered the Old Town Shrimp (4 shrimp), 1/2 Doz Oysters, and the Cornbread Mini Muffins (which we were then told they were out of and had just started making more ""Do you want to wait on them?""   We told him no, ate our 4 shrimp, 6 oysters and ask for the bill.  He never updated us on our food, never checked on us, never brought the water.  Our meal:  4 shrimp, 6 oysters, 1 Old Fashion drink, 1 beer, 2 LaMarca-with 1 oz St. Germain ($22/each). Our bill was just under $100 before tip.  Bottom line:  Food was great... if you can ever get it.  We left to find food, still hungry."
SOCU,5,"Art walk was in the air.   Along with an 50 percent chance of rain.  Didn't stop us.  After walking up and down Dauphin street visiting different shops, museums and now dodging scooters, we worked up quite an appetite.  Queue up SOCU and our 8:30 reservation.  I decided to bring the kids with me this time.  I think they seated us near the front door in that cute little table next to the kitchen so they could keep an eye on us.  LoL.  I enjoyed it cause it was like sitting at a Chefs Table.  We could see how they prepared the delicious meals.  I'm really proud of MOB & SOCU.  I'm enjoying or cities new growth and delicious options.  Everything was simply delish.  Happily optimistic we tried a bit of everything on the menu.  Check out these pics. No complaints from my crew.  From the chicken and waffles to the oceans eleven.  Finished off with the banana pudding.  ""Another must do is SOCU and U""Our hostess Kim was cute as a button.  Our new server David made certain we wanted for nothing.  Great job guys and gals.  We will return."
SOCU,3,"Beautiful addition to the Dauphin Street restaurant scene! I'd been waiting so patiently to try SOCU.My goal was to wait until all the ""new biz dust"" settled and they were well  into the groove of their standard. Well, here we are and after taking all things into account, it's a 3.5ish currently. Hubs and I visited last night after booking on Open Table! (I appreciate the nice touch of convenience.) Upon arrival, I was pleased to see familiar faces in Mobile's dining scene working here. We were immediately greeted and seated by Apryl (whom I love as she's always represented herself as the epitome of professionalism) and passed off to Anna (our server for the evening). The restaurant is clean, well laid out. The decor and furniture is cute also.We started with the bacon deviled eggs appetizer, and enjoyed it. The sweet & spicy hints were nice! I wanted to get a taste of as much as possible without having to be carried out, so I ordered the shrimp and grits, and convinced the hubs to get the oxtails and rice (his absolute favorite, always) with my favorite sides (mac & cheese and greens), and I came with cornbread! #Winning Quick sidebar-- Just do you know, the mere sight of these menu offerings brought a tiny tear to my eye. Hubs and I were all in! We ordered in two seconds, flat as all the ""key players"" in southern soul food are here! The only thing left to do was execute -- and that's where I took issue. Plating and presentation was nice. My shrimp and grits were pretty good! Flavors were there, and shrimp was cooked perfectly. The greens and cornbread were delish. Mac & cheese missed the mark in flavor and my preference of cheese to noodle ratio, but the oxtails were a major fail. Poor hubs was beside himself. On sight, they were big and beautiful. The seasonings we expected to see were there (hello, thyme sprigs), but the flavor follow through fell flat. Watching the hubs peel back layer after layer of un-rendered fat to give me an adequate taste, had to be the reason. (But don't worry, I videoed if for you.) We called Apryl over to show her and share our concern, and she insisted on removing it from the check. All in all, among the other neighboring players, SOCU's price point is on par, and the kitchen has great potential. I'm committed to coming back to try again with their brunch that I've been hearing about, cocktails, and the Hennessy peach cobbler that I was eyeing before I was forced to tap out.To be continued..."
SOCU,3,"This was my first visit to the new SOCU.  I was admittedly super excited to make a visit, I've heard good things about this place.  The only negative I've heard was that service was slow.Visited on a Thursday evening.  The hostess was friendly and quick to seat a party of 2.  No reservation was required but I'd highly suggest.  The time I was there it was a constant flow of people some of which chose bar seating. The menu is not overwhelming but not basic.  Very much a higher level southern cooking.  My dish was a mixed bag.  The asparagus seemed to be blanched which wasn't bad but not a star.  The mac and cheese was southern gourmet served in a cute little cast iron skillet.  Still, days later, on the fence about its taste.  The salmon and seafood dressing was delightful.  Every bite bursting with flavor and cooked perfectly.  Was the dish worth $30, no.Also had a side of mashed sweet potatoes. Taste more like whipped sweet potatoes pie crust with extra sugar.  Don't order.The drink menu was surprisingly solid with a variety of wine, beer and specialty drinks.  For dessert I ran towards the Hennessy Peach Cobbler.  I'm wishing I would have just walked.  The portion is great topped with ice cream.  The cobbler crust was slightly overcooked and the favors of peach were not very strong.Overall, the place is a upcoming star.  It's worth a try.  Let me know your experience and I might try it again."
SOCU,5,"When it is time to celebrate and enjoy delicious food like your mama made... head to SOCUI really treasure these 3 friends- They have made me a better - more aware - person through different work situations and honest real talk.We laugh hard and eat well and this evening was no exception- Make reservations now to enjoy some of Mobile's finest dishes. Anna was our server and she was spot on with her recommendations - from the candied bacon devil eggs -to the melt in your mouth Mama's chicken and waffles- you can't go wrong.  All of us did not save room for dessert and that is not like me at all- so I'm going back next time and starting with their dessert ""Church Lady Banana Pudding"" and I'm requesting to sit in those blue chairs by the entrance (see pic) with a view of the kitchen staff working their magic."
SOCU,5,"Mobile, AL is my second home. I'm originally from Huntsville but both of my parents are from Mobile. I was super excited to hear about SOCU! My cousin told me about it and I had to come visit. The restaurant is located in downtown Mobile, and the menu is your typical southern cuisine menu. I love southern cuisine so I was excited. Everyone at the table ordered the same things. Lol. We all ordered the shrimp and grits, seafood pasta, and shrimp and salmon dish. We had deviled eggs and shrimp as the appetizers. Everything was fantastic! The drinks weren't that good. They could use a little work on their alcoholic beverages but the food was on point. I heard they're oxtails we're very good! We didn't have any but I will definitely go back to order that. I definitely recommend the collard greens as a side. Very tasty. If you're in the area I would suggest that you go check it out."
SOCU,4,"SOCU is a great addition to Mobile. We don't have many restaurants that offer a new type of southern cuisine. I've had the pork chops, the smothered pork chops, Fried Chicken, Spring Rolls, Oysters, and Fried Fish. Each time I've gone, me and my dining partners have enjoyed our experience. A business associate from out of town asked for a great place to eat and I recommended SOCU. I really enjoyed the pork hops. They were cooked perfectly and the crawfish sauce is great. The seafood dressing is also a star. The Fried Chicken was piping hot, juicy, and flavorful. The Fish was great and the oysters are on point. If your visiting Mobile, it's highly recommended."
SOCU,5,"This is downtown Mobile's newest spot and I for one hope it stays forever. Located in the old Sai Sho, SOCU is a chefed version of your grand mother's cookbook. The atmosphere is lively with music and simple but comfortable decor. The kitchen is open giving diners a chance to keep up and also view all the dishes as they come out of the kitchen. They don't serve alcohol yet, they are waiting for approval from the ABC board. For starters we had Fried Lobster Deviled eggs, Old Town Road shrimp, and SOCU signature chargrilled oysters. The oysters are covered in cheese, crawfish, crab and then beautiful sized, and perfectly cooked oysters. The deviled eggs were amazing, perfectly fried lobster and wonderful lightly whipped deviled eggs. The Old Town Road shrimp are perfectly fried, covered in a tangy, sauce and absolutely amazing. I could have eaten four plates. Entrees I had some of the best fried chicken served with collards and cheese grits. Three big pieces of chicken and sides served in side sized cast iron... drooling. She had the fried pork chop and let me just say one of the best I've ever had. The pricing for this place couldn't be better 18 bucks for entrees, we really had a wonderful meal and I have spent more on worse. I hope to be a frequent flyer at this awesome new restaurant!"
SOCU,5,"I've heard great things about this place and had to see what the hype was about. Let's just say I was very impressed. The service was Excellent! Friendly staff and great vibe. Even the music was good because they played a mix of 90's RnB in the background and not the standard corny elevator music you would normally see at restaurants. The food was 5 star quality! It was fresh, tasteful, and soulful. So good I wanted to adopt the owner so they could be in the family, just so they could provide the food for family get togethers. All that said I will be back."
SOCU,5,SOCU gets 5 stars!!! The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. We made reservations for after church and we were the 1st ones seated. We ordered the fried lobster deviled eggs for an appetizer and they were AHMAZING!!!! I got the special of the day which was an Asian glazed Mahi Mahi with seafood fried rice and asparagus and I've never had anything like it. Beau got the fried catfish platter with mac n cheese and mashed sweet potatoes and he said it was great. We were really impressed. SOCU really exceeded our expectations. We will be back soon.
SOCU,4,"A friend and I went to dinner at Socu on a week night. Reservations were easy to make for an early evening dinner and the hostess was very accommodating. We started with fried lobster deviled eggs and Socu signature oysters. The deviled eggs were some of the best we have ever had. The signature oysters were good but not very memorable. For our entrees, we ordered Oceans 11 platter with seafood dressing and the oxtails with Mac and cheese and a side of collard greens.The seafood platter was good but the salmon could have been cooked a little less. The seafood dressing was delicious. Mashed potatoes were alright. The oxtails were tender and well prepared, but everything else on the plate could use some improvement. The gravy would have been excellent if they took half the salt out. It was very salty, not to the point of inedible but still. The Mac and cheese had good flavor but were so dry. The collard greens had all liquid squeezed out of them and they were sweet which also did not appeal to me. There also was some rice on the plate, which had function of an inexpensive filler, in my opinion. Both my friend and I, took leftovers home. The seasonings on the Oceans 11 platter became too strong the next day; my friend ended up tossing most of it.  The oxtails became considerably better after flavors had a chance to marry and soak up the gravy, I enjoyed my leftovers much better than I did my actual dinner ( but the Mac and cheese was still too dry). The service overall was very good. Our server got busy with newly seated tables and forgot my dessert order which was disappointing.All in all, we will give them another try in a few months. The chef-owner definitely knows how to cook and has some great ideas."
SOCU,4,"Beautiful atmosphere and the the service is impeccable. The specialty cocktails are so tasty. My friend was given fried chicken because they had to redo his order. The chicken was seasoned to perfection! The salmon, scallops, shrimp, and mashed potatoes was great as well. The only downside was when they had to redo the pasta dish, it took a very long time and we had ask for it to go instead."
SOCU,3,"When our party 1st arrived there was a line at the door but it was confusing to know where to check in for the reservation. Once we checked in the said we would get the 1st available table, but we did not.Though our party had reservations, it took about 45 minutes for us to be seated because the hostess made a mistake and gave away our table. There was more than one instance of confusion on the part of the hostess table during our visit.Once seated, we ordered our drinks and food all at once. The drinks were not well balanced. The Hurricane was too strong and medicinal tasting, the Dauphin Island iced teas tasted watered down and did not taste like raspberry or sweet and sour, the Rolex tasted mainly like Crown Royal and not much else.The food portions are big. The Salmon and scallops on the 'Oceans 11' Salmon was cooked perfectly but the spice rub was salty and the mashed potatoes cold. Macaroni and cheese was a nice herb seasoning and was my favorite side dish. The banana pudding dessert was a nice portion but very sweet. The food is a little overpriced. 4 deviled eggs for $12? You could easily take $4 off the price of all the menu items accept for desserts."
SOCU,3,"The food was great but over priced, it took some time to get served but once we did Monica took good care of us.  Perfect for people who are experienced with southern cooking.  I would return for grilled oysters and a specialty drink only."
SOCU,4,"Their Sunday brunch is really good. Not an expansive menu, but definitely worth it. Be sure to try the grits. They're the star of the show."
SOCU,4,"Found them on yelp as we drive from TX to Fl and called to see if they were open on Sunday but no one answered. We drove up and they were open! Pretty busy but we were seated immediately right up front on the coveted, cushy blue chairs.Anna introduced herself and was a great server. She took our appetizer order for the deviled eggs with bacon and as she said, they were delicious!My husband ordered the signature oysters and I ordered 3 sides, greens, jalapeño creamed corn and seafood stuffing.Everything came out quickly but everything was rich, salty and sweet. I couldn't finish the stuffing but I'm glad I tried everything.Then i ordered the rose  cider and it was refreshing and we couldn't leave without trying the banana pudding. It was crunchy with cookies and creamy and homemade. Really delicious!The ambiance was great and they stayed busy.The women's restaurant had no paper towels and the hand dryer was broken but they finally put paper towels in there.Street parking only.They had upstairs seating too!Great restaurant and hope to return.Thank you"
SOCU,4,"What a GEM to add to downtown Mobile! Fair warning: usually SOCU is PACKED especially during popular nights surrounding the downtown calendar. I would highly  suggest to make a reservation regardless of party size to truly enjoy the experience (on the website there is a quick and easy way to secure your spot). While I would consider this to be ""fine"" dining, it is such a warm and casual approach to the experience. The hours are a bit tricky and if I'm not mistaken they are open from Wednesday to Sunday and will begin the lunch menu in early 2020. Don't forget dessert!  The Hennessy Peach cobbler was amazing!!"
SOCU,5,"Everything was EXCELLENT!!! The staff, atmosphere, food!!! Everything about this restaurant was amazing!! I will be back soon AND often!!!"
SOCU,5,"""May I slap the dimples off your face?"" Yes... that's exactly what I said to the chef when he approached my table. Forget slapping your mama! This food is so good you want to slap whomever is responsible! The first night I tried the fried lobster deviled eggs. My immediate response, ""Good God from Zion!"" The second visit I ordered the lamb chops with sweet potato soufflé and collards. Again, my immediate response, ""Is my grandmother in that kitchen?"" I can only imagine what my third visit will hold. I'm ready to test the waters again and again and again!! You can't miss this new hot spot!!! You'll live to regret it! Trust me!!!"
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,"I've never been inside, but my mother always brings some home whenever she gets cravings for good ol' southern style veggies and soul food. I'm blown away every time we eat this for dinner. The fried chicken is divine and the veggies (black eyed peas, green beans, etc) are insanely well seasoned. I tried the baked chicken last time, & while it's obviously no fried chicken.... I enjoyed it just as much. The cornbread dressing tastes like your grandmother's homemade dressing during Thanksgiving instead of that store bought Stove-Top kind some places serve. This will continue to be my go to spot for classic & delicious southern cuisine!"
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,"Headed to New Orleans for the CFP National Championship and used yelp to find this place.  After pulling up in the parking lot we went in on the faith of the other reviews bc it didn't look like much on the outside.  The food was awesome and the staff couldn't have been nicer.! Greeted us as soon as we came in the door and took care of everything we needed from start to finish.  Great ribs and my brother said the pork chops were the best he has ever had,  and we like to cook ourselves.  Don't know what they put in the collards and the green beans but both of those were unreal.  Definitely recommend."
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,"Excellent food, server and overall service.  This place was a definite treat to my palate.  The restaurant is ""small in space but great in taste,"" as paraphrased by the inscription on the outside wall.  Prior to entering, you're olfactory system is getting a serious workout.  We were instantly met with amazing whiffs of good ole southern 'Sweet Home Alabama' cooking.  As a party of 5 here for lunch, everyone sampled just about every entree they had to offer. We were served in a cafeteria style setting for dine-in but take out is definitely available.  The menu today offered BBQ Ribs and Chicken, Baked Chicken, Smothered Turkey Necks, Meat Loaf and Fried Chicken and you're given three sides with cornbread for under $10.  As for drinks, they serve lemonade, kool-aid and sweet tea with free refills....you also have the option of bottled beverages.  I highly recommend Mary's for your southern soul food fix and awesome hospitality."
Mary’s Southern Cooking,4,"As you can see, by my past post, I travel quite a bit for work, so yet again I relied on the locals to lead me on good eats in the area.I'm a sucker for good BBQ, and soul comfort food.I was recommended to give Mary's Southern kitchen a go.Pulled up, parking lot is fairly small, luckily my Lil Toyota was able to squeeze into an outside parking spot.I walked in and the dining seating area was full of patrons... Good look I stood and line looking at the cafeteria style line up. The special of the day was fried chicken so of course of had to go with that.All the fixings for a southern meal fix were displayed.Greens, yams, Mac n cheese, black eyed peas, mashed potatoes, gravy, rice...The gentleman behind the counter was sweet and patient.For $12 bucks I got a breast, 2 wings, yams, greens, Mac, corn bread muffin and sweet tea!!Sweet tea was the perfect amount of hebegebees I look for! YasssChicken was crispy, and hot!Mac n cheese wasn't the best I ever had but it did the trick.Obviously my favorite was the yams. Yas oh yes, highly pleased I've made two seperate visits on my work trips to Mary's because I enjoy it so much!Def my soul food fix anytime I'm in Mobile!"
Mary’s Southern Cooking,4,"Get ready for your workout..... my wrist was getting tired holding my to go box after they gave it to me! They pack it FULL! Southern food & southern servings. I got the red beans & rice with green beans, yams, corn bread & a sweet tea. My total was only $10 and some change. For the amount of food I got, this was a GREAT deal. The food was overall good but my only complaint is the rice was super bland. It had no salt, no pepper, no butter, no nothing! It was just plain white rice. It was so bland that it took away from the great flavor of the red beans & rice! You do get 2 big chunks of sausage on top which is something I've never seen done before. I'm not sure how I feel about it........ The yams & green beans were delicious. I have absolutely no complaints there. The staff was kind of quiet & not very welcoming. The woman working the check out seemed annoyed & was not very pleasant. It was nothing too bad that I wouldn't come back though. I am for sure coming back here & recommending this place to friends. Oh, & one more odd thing.... there is a camera RIGHT in your face at the second food station. It kind of threw me off & confused me. I don't know why it is right there versus at the register. I'm assuming there is one there too. The camera is just SO close to your face. (See photos)"
Mary’s Southern Cooking,3,Food looked amazing came in to get macaroni and cheese for a recipe I was making at home. The line was almost out the door. The gentleman making the plates was quick and very efficient with completing the plate orders. He was friendly and made the wait not so long just watching him. Lots of homemade cake and pies. Cashier on her cell phone not really greeting the customers as the other staff.
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,Unbelievable Place! From the service to the taste to the selections to the amount of food you're given.... absolutely worth a visit! And a return visit and another visit.....
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,"Mary's is THE 100% ABSOLUTELY BEST resturant in Mobile.  I would pick it over anywhere else any day of the week.  I love the fried chicken the most, but I also love the pork, ox tails, and all the other mains. As for sides, the mashed potatoes, green beans, and greens are the best to me - along with the cornbread of course!  If you haven't been here yet, you MUST try it out - even if it is a hour drive for you.Also, everyone is super kind. Don't let the building fool you - the inside is clean and even the customers are friendly. I often take a long lunch break to sneak over to Mary's - it's that good!"
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,This was my first visit to Mary's; I'm ashamed to admit. I pass by this place a minimum of 4 times a month and have never stopped in. What a mistake!!!!!!!! The service is wonderfully friendly! The food is fantastic. As a native Mobilian I've never experienced a soul food restaurant that I would be proud to which I would bring out of town guest until now! I can't wait to return to try different dishes! Sitting in Mary's eating my food felt much like sitting at home or in grandma's dining room! I will definitely be back for more!
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,"My family and I were in town for the Reese's Senior Bowl. Stopped here for lunch and was blown away! Southern Comfort Food!!!! Everything was fresh, flavorful, and mouthwatering. I felt like I was in my grandmothers kitchen! Mary, the owner gave us great southern hospitality. I will definitely be back! Highly recommend!"
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,So on our trip leaving Biloxi heading back home to Panama City we decided to check out Mary's Southern Cooking... When I say it was Delicious the barbecue pig feet oooh whee WONDERFUL . Everyone was so friendly & welcoming we will return again.
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,Boy boy boy I tell ! If you in a mood for some good southern home cooking in Mobile ... this is the spot ! Setup kinda like buffet style with everything made fresh. In a matter of one week I visited this spot 4 times and was telling all my coworker about it. All of the selections are delicious.
Mary’s Southern Cooking,4,"We were looking for good home cooking and Mary's was recommended and they did not disappoint.  I had oxtails, macaroni and cheese, cornbread and black eyed peas and it was delicious! This was just what the doctor ordered and I would return again! I would return again just for the Kool Aid I felt like I was back in grandmas kitchen!"
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,"I'm a SUPER fan of souther cooking/soul food/down home, or whatever you want to call it. To me it's just mama's cookin!!! I had some family come in from other parts of the country where they don't eat grits. One of them proceeded to tell me she didn't like seafood.... after a long awkward pause and a look of disappointment in their life choices, I started looking. Of course Cracker Barrel and a few of the other ""chains"" came up as options, but they have those in other places of the world. So we decided on Mary's....    l've got to tell you I'm mad as hell right now!!! WHY!? In the name of all that is right and holy have I never been here!?!?!? Unfortunately they were out of Oxtails. But the turkey necks were freaking amazing. The broccoli casserole and cabbage were excellent.  As a matter of fact I didn't taste ANYTHING that wasn't pretty awesome.  The service was as good as it gets. They are exceptionally friendly, and very helpful. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!!!!"
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,"Ms Mary is a class act.  My family needed a place to eat after college graduation and she accommodated our large party of 40 with NO problem.  The service was fast, the food was great and everyone had a seat.  My ribs were HUGE and tender.  The fried shrimp were so big, I almost thought it was a prawn.  My sides were seasoned to perfection.  I am still full 5 hrs later!!  Thank you!!"
Mary’s Southern Cooking,4,"I'll give it a solid 3.5 for now, and I may or may not have momentarily feared for my life while tracking down soul food, alone in a strange Mobilian land! But Yelp said that Mary's Southern Cooking was the place to be for the best soul food in the city, so I popped the address into the GPS and blindly took on a 20 minute venture to take a crack at it. I've gotta hand it to ol' Mary, the food is pretty good. It's cafeteria style and I placed a carry out order of the oxtails and rice plate. Although the oxtails were definitely more fatty than I like and not falling off the bone, the flavor was on point. The greens, sweet tea, and macaroni and cheese were pretty good also. I'll definitely stop back in (with the hubs in tow) to give a few more items on the menu a whirl! It's good, but I can't give it the crown just yet. To be continued..."
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,"Feels so homey when you walk in. The food is AMAZING. I had the baked chicken and it was seasoned beautifully and paired with the yams, Mac, and greens, it sent me straight to heaven. The staff showcased that Southern hospitality that I've been hearing about because they truly take care of you once you get in. Not to mentioned it's a black owned business, which for me makes the experience even more special. Thank you Mary's."
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,"Good down home soul food!  Go early, towards the end of the day the food is not as fresh as in earlier in the day.  Still very good food!"
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,"Delicious! This gem is filled with southern eats! Turkey necks to red beans and rice with sausage, it all looked good! I would suggest you get it togo although I ate inside! Several people got their fried chicken! My friend thought their Mac and cheese was great! I prefer mine a bit creamier, however I loved their greens!"
Mary’s Southern Cooking,5,"Im coming from Houston. Ill be there for lunch tomorrow. Lets make it a 5 star review.  Oxtails and rice with yams, greens, cornbread and maybe some pie?  ..... I'll review again after lunch."
Half Shell Oyster House,5,"My family visited Mobile for Mardi Gra and decided to try this restaurant.  The oysters are amazing.  My family ordered the oysters, seafood pasta and shrimp.  Everyone was satisfied with their food and had no complaints.  The restaurant is extremely popular and was really busy when we arrived.  The hostess seated us quickly and it didn't take long for us to be served and to get our food.  I ordered the pasta and was pleased with the flavor and portion.  The dish had just the right amount of sauce and I was able to take a portion home.  If you are in the Mobile area you should try this restaurant.  I will certainly return during my next visit to the city."
Half Shell Oyster House,1,Spent 15 dollars on a lyft to come here.  Because i heard they had great oysters.  Hell its in the name.I get here and they say they ran out due to Corona.  Yet i called 3 other restaurants in the area and they all laughed and said of course we have oysters.Dont come here.  If they cant figure out how to buy oysters who knows what else is wrong with them.Their only saving point is the service is excellent especially the bartender
Half Shell Oyster House,4,"Got to pick up some food from this little gem during my stay in town. With the whole COVID pandemic, they offered to bring the food right to your car when you pick up. The service was friendly, the food was fresh and flavorful and the location was super convenient to my hotel. The fried okra side was huge and perfectly fried. I got the oyster po boy which was chock full of fried oysters! Yum! I didn't really care for the grilled oysters though because the oyster shells weren't cleaned well and there were a lot of shell bits on the oysters. I also liked that this location offered to sell some household staples from their pantry if you needed items like flour, rice, eggs etc. I think that was very considerate considering our current stay at home situation."
Half Shell Oyster House,5,We were meeting a colleague that was staying in a different hotel out of the downtown area and this was the #1 rated place in the area for very good reason!!All three of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals and Carmen took good of us and made sure to provide excellent service.I started out with a bowl of seafood Bisque My colleague started with a doz. raw oysters on the half shell.  We all also got a Caesar Salad for a starter.  I ordered the snapper au gratin with cajun potatoes.  One of my colleagues got the bacon encrusted redfish. And the other got the seafood stuffed Portabellas.After a long day working in both the office and field this meal really hit the spot.  I will definitely keep this place on my mobile collections for my next visit. Thank you for an excellent dining experience!!
Half Shell Oyster House,5,"My family stopped here on our way home from the gulf. Everywhere else was packed so we thought why not try it. The environment is nice. We didn't have to wait at all to be seated. Our server was prompt and attentive. My extremely picky son wouldn't order anything so she offered to have the cook make chicken nuggets even though it's not listed on the menu. I was impressed by her thoughtfulness. The fried crab claws were bigger than we've gotten anywhere else. My husband got the tuna steak. It was phenomenal. I had the seafood platter and was able to substitute more shrimp for oysters. My food was delicious, the crab cake was my favorite as it wasn't super thick. The jalapeño hush puppies were really tasty too. I didn't get any pictures because we were hangry by the time we got there and wasted no time digging in. We will definitely be back."
Half Shell Oyster House,5,"A strip mall restaurant that has some great seafood. It was so good the first night, our group returned the next night!  The best items i tried was the smoked tuna spread, the fried crab claws, the crawfish-shrimp-corn bisque. But thee best item was the Ruby Shrimp. So good that our group ate four pounds!  Both nights the service was good. Being from the west is like to see more draft beers, maybe a couple from Mobile. Overall though, the drink selection was good. Not everything was as good as the items mentioned above. One of our group got steak; wasn't cooked as requested. Side of risotto was 'basic'. I'd recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good food especially seafood. I recommend everyone give them a try. The food."
Half Shell Oyster House,4,"Mobile's Half Shell is pretty good. I'm a bit partial to the Biloxi location, but it's all good! Hubs' almond crusted chicken was delish (yep, I taste tested), and he also enjoyed his Old Fashioned(s). My seafood pasta was decent, however I'm excited about letting my leftovers marinate and see if I get a bolder flavor (yep, I'm a little weird at times) tomorrow. The smoked tuna dip, garlic bread, and crawfish, crab, and corn bisque were straight fire! (loved 'em) Carmen, our server, was attentive and friendly. All in all, great date at Half Shell and I'm planning to return soon to check out their happy hour."
Half Shell Oyster House,4,Fried green tomatoes and crab cakes are delicious. I recommend the royal red risotto app. Our server was not very good. He took 15 minutes to greet our table. He took 10 minutes to deliver our drinks. He got our order wrong.
Half Shell Oyster House,4,"Wow! This place is amazing! I stopped in on a Friday afternoon during Happy Hour for a few drinks and a nice dinner before the rush came.  I started out with half a dozen chargrilled oysters. They were pretty good. My meal consisted of grilled Redfish Orleans, grilled Asparagus, and Sweet Potato Crème brûlée. It was amazing!  Really wish I'd discovered this place sooner as my four month project is nearing an end in the area.  If you are ever on I-10 or I-65 in Mobile, Alabama, I suggest stopping by for dinner. You will not be disappointed."
Half Shell Oyster House,5,"Omg if you are looking for a great seafood restaurant in Mobile, you definitely need to check out Half Shell. Some friends and I were down celebrating Mardi Gras and was told great things about this restaurant. We decided to stop by for lunch and I was especially happy because they had an awesome lunch menu with discounted prices. We all ordered soup as an appetizer. I had the shrimp gumbo and my friends had the lobster bisque. Each soup was hot and fresh and had plenty of flavor and meat. For my entree, I had the seafood pasta and a side salad. Another friend had the grilled red fish and another friend had the grilled shrimp dish. Again just like the soup, each entree was packed with flavor and also came with a side, which was a plus. The only criticism I had was my pasta was on the dry side and by the time the waitress brought out more sauce, I was pretty much done. But it was that good, I didn't feel like waiting to eat it lol. For the lunch prices, the entrees were a good size and were very filling. The food was so good that we came back the next day for lunch again! Lol. The service was fantastic as well. I can't remember our waitress's name, but she was very knowledgeable, thorough and patient. Next time I visit Mobile, I will definitely come back!"
Half Shell Oyster House,4,"This is one of our favorite seafood restaurants. We always enjoy the food and the atmosphere. We usually come here for special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries. We did have a great time last night with family and friends. The drinks were on point. I recommend the Pink Pearl Martini and the Wild Berry Martini.  My dad and I had the  Red Fish Orleans. It was so delicious. It had just the right amount of spice and  the lump crab and blackened shrimp on top was delicious. my husband had the Pecan and Bacon encrusted red fish. He enjoyed it a lot. It was moist and flaky. My uncle had the herb encrusted mahi mahi and it was super flavorful.If you are looking for an appetizer, the crab ""beignets "" are fantastic!!! Light breaded lump crab with right amount of spice .We did run into a few snags w the restaurant. One, we called a couple days in advance to try and make reservations. We were told it was against their policy to accept reservations. I believe this is a little ridiculous. One, they are a more upscale restaurant and we did have a party of 15. They screwed up a couple of the tickets because their plan on how to handle them was quite flawed. All in all. We drank and ate and were merry!"
Half Shell Oyster House,5,You can't get much better than this for some amazing seafood!!!   Worth it.  Go it's just like being in New Orleans
Half Shell Oyster House,5,"Except food and service was great! My waitress was Kale and she was an excellent server with impeccable customer service. The calamari was tender and seasoned well. The oysters were not fried hard, which means the waitress relayed my message. The broccoli as and asparagus was crispy and seasoned extremely well. No salt or other condiments were needed. Excellent experience!"
Half Shell Oyster House,5,Perfect meal for Valentine's Day brunch. The Royal Red Endymion was a great selection by our server who was fanatic. For the entree we had Almond crusted chicken and the Ahi tuna sandwich.  A glass of the Frei Brothers Chardonnay and the Southern Pecan Old Fashion made each meal better!  If you go...I would definitely sit where the bartender can also be your server. He had great recommendations and timed the delivery of each course!!
Half Shell Oyster House,5,"Upon arrival, we were told it would be a 20 minute wait for a table for two. We only waited half that time before our buzzer went off and we were escorted to a quaint little table in the back. It had a feel of privacy and the lighting was dim enough to be romantic, but not too dark to alter sight. Our server was very attentive and friendly. The food was excellent, as always. (Did I mention this is one of my favorite restaurants?) This place is always packed, but never, not even once, have we ever had service or food that was less than stellar. 5 stars across the board."
Half Shell Oyster House,5,"We stayed a night in Mobile Alabama and wanted to eat something special for dinner. Our hotel was near Half Shell and we are glad we stopped by for dinner. The staff greeted us as we walked in and we were seated immediately. They have happy hour 3-6pm which includes discounted drinks and HH size appetizers. We ordered draft beer, a doze. charbroiled oysters, tuna dip, and shrimp and voodoo shrimp poboys. Everything was delicious and portions were generous. We were so stuffed that we had to take half of our sandwiches to go. Definitely stop by here if you want some delicious oysters, you won't be disappointed!"
Half Shell Oyster House,4,Second time visiting. We found this restaurant last year while in Mobile. We remembered how much we liked it so we decided to return. I had the  Royal Redfish and my husband had the Grilled Red  fish. Be both had the same side Sweet Potato Creme Brulee. This was one of the main reasons we returned this year and it was just as good as we remembered. The meal was great but I gave it a 4 star because the server never came to refill my drink until we were ready to leave.
Half Shell Oyster House,4,"The wife and I stopped in here for lunch about a month ago. We had a mixed bad experience but management came through with flying colors to rescue the day. I had a wonderful tuna steak sandwich. Great sandwich. My wife had the crab and shrimp dip, which she found just ok and the bread was a tad stale. However, the manager gave us a gift cert to make up for the mishap. We will be back in to give this highly thought of spot another try."
Half Shell Oyster House,5,"I visit Mobile often for work. I usually stay near Airport Boulevard and have noticed this place several times and never stopped in. Believe, me when I say, I'll be back here at least once every trip I take from now on! The bartenders are amazing: Gabi, Jackson, and Ryan! You all really made me feel at home! The atmosphere is great and I event got to meet a few locals to give me some advice on what to do with my weekend in town!  This is a true gem in Mobile and I'll be sure to visit again soon! Thank you for such a wonderful night -- need to try more of your food -- just had oysters and champagne this night but even those were delicious :)"
Half Shell Oyster House,4,First visit to this location but visited the Gulfport locations. Few times and have never been disappointed.  Thanks his location doesn't have the same feel but food was delicious and staff very friendly ..and the most important part of all. The chargrilled oysters were perfect!Ruby reds were sweet but really needed to be cleaned  in my opinion.  Fried green tomatoes and crab cake starter was good and would have been better with less toppings.  Still a Trusted option and happy to have visited
The Spiffy Fox,5,"Great spot! Excellent food. Excellent lunch special. The owner is fantastic, talked to us a lot about things. Great environment. Highly suggest this spot!!"
The Spiffy Fox,4,"I hate to write this review. I hate to say one negative word. The food was so amazing but I can't get my husband to even consider coming back because it took so long to get our food last time. While we sat there two other groups got up and left. The waiter even suggested that they do so for as packed as they were that night. To be fair, it was a Friday night, they were short-staffed and it was packed!!! There was one waiter and a little girl (maybe 12 or 13 years old) and two rooms of hungry people. We wish we had known they had no liquor license before we had come, that would've been doable to pick up our own. But, there were no indications of that on any website, including yelp! (Will add that as a tip!) But, really the food was so amazing I can't give this lower than 4 stars. The dessert pizza was so unique and delicious! It had mascarpone cheese, honey and pears? Was it? I am dreaming about that dessert pizza! And the crust on all the pizzas was divine! They know what they're doing with it! Their branding was great! The Spiffy fox logos everywhere, but if they don't get some help I'm afraid they won't survive! And I really want them to survive! Please guys! Get it together!!! And now to work on convincing the hubs we have another 3 hrs to waste on pizza... it would be worth it to me!"
The Spiffy Fox,4,Hard to locate if you don't know the one way streets in the area - extremely friendly staff - small and cozy inside. I got the $10 special including side salad-small pizza and a coke. Also a order of their bread knots with marinara dipping sauce. Everything was fresh and and tasty- Zelda was amazing
The Spiffy Fox,5,"After two visits I'm convinced this is my new go-to pizza joint. And there are plenty of great one to choose from! Living in WEMO, I always ask myself ""is this worth a special trip?"" and, in this case, the answer is unequivocally yes!!! So, five stars since I'd drive out of my way. Ambiance is causal and has a pretty cool vibe - hard to explain - exposed brick, old pub feel. Definitely comfortable. Stained glass windows are a nice touch. The red sauce is so fresh tasting and plenty of basil - totally what I'm looking for in sauce. So, your opinion on the sauce might be based on how much you do/don't like that particular herb. The sauce is served with the cheese bread. Which isn't your typical cheese bread - the cheese is stuffed in a crescent type knot. They use a wood fired oven, so the crust is just right. I've tried several pies, but my favorite is the margherita (again, I love basil). Haven't tried the spicy pizza yet, but it's next on my list. My husband loved the carnivore one - not really my thing, but I'm sure it's popular. For dessert, the apple and mascarpone dessert pizza is worth saving room for, IMO. It's not overly sweet, but the apples are thinly sliced and it sprinkled with cinnamon - sooooo good! Haven't tried the Fox in a hole, but saw a lot of people getting it and it looked yummy.Final note, they have gaelic knots, not to be confused with garlic knots!! They're good, as long as you're not expecting garlic!! Oh yeah, no kids menu!! My daughter is ten and both times she was finished after two (out of four) slices from the 8 inch. Not a huge deal to me, but I know that might matter to some folks."
The Spiffy Fox,4,"Buffalo pizza is delicious, so is the Margarita!  The crust is  very crunchy on thhe edges, a little too soft in the middle but tastes great.  The don't  have alcohol yet but you can bring your own.  Can't wait to try some other pizzas."
The Spiffy Fox,3,"5 star food but 2 star service. Thus the 3 star review. The pizzas had a great flavor. Wonderful crust and great brick oven flavor. We had ""the fox"" which is a supreme and a Pepperoni. Both pizzas were great. The Ceaser salad dressing was awesome. So why the sub par review??? Well when got there it was packed...but no one had pizzas on their table. We were seated in a side room and ordered within 10 min of arriving. However it took about another 15 min to get waters. Another 30 min to get our salads and it was a total of about an hour before we got our pizzas. There was literally one waiter on a Friday night at 6pm that was running, seating , busing, and hosting the whole place, along with the 9 year old. Literally one waiter for the wholePlace. He was swamped. We noticed 2 different tables get drinks order and got tired of waiting and just left. We also saw another table sit for 20 min and never got talked to so they left. I'm not sure if this is normal but the service was terrible. The waiter was trying his best....but it was just too many people to keep up with. The food was amazing. We also got the jelly dessert pizza with the apples and cinnamon with the Marscapone cheese. It was to die for. But you gotta have a staff on a Friday night to keep up with demand. And you have to have more than one waiter for the whole place!!! Also FYI they don't serve alcohol yet so it's BYOB wish we would have known. All the regulars just bring it with them when they walk in."
The Spiffy Fox,1,"I hate to put a negative review for a local business, but we've ordered from here three times and twice they got it wrong.  I placed an order for fish and chips and got chips and hash browns.  Also ordered a chicken salad and they forgot the chicken.  Placed the order through grub hub (big mistake), was notified that the order was ready, went to pick it up, was told order was not ready, waited 40 minutes for food that was not even correct.  I called and they offered to refund/fix the order, but I didn't want to wait another hour+.  The pizza seems to be consistently good, but I'd say there are much better places in midtown/downtown that will get your order right more than 50% of the time and in a timely manner."
The Spiffy Fox,5,"The pizza was delicious! We had the Margherita and the Spicy Pie. The tomato sauce on the Margherita was sublime. The house made Caesar salad dressing was out of this world. It is very evident that everything is prepared with high quality ingredients. I hate we were too full to try the apple pie pie, but will definitely try it next time. We met the owner who has such a great vision for this space. Delicious food, excellent service, warm, happy, and welcoming atmosphere equals The Spiffy Fox."
The Spiffy Fox,5,"Love love love this place! The pub fries with the different dipping sauces are the perfect appetizer!! Super crunchy fries which I love. The Caesar salad was fantastic and the pepperoni pizza was on point. Prices are great, too! I love that it's so close to my work as well."
The Spiffy Fox,4,they have the best fries i've ever had. the atmosphere is great! pizza is good. everyone always talks about the margherita pizza and how great it is but it's all says and hardly any cheese. also the pizza isn't that great to take home. it gets really soggy. other than that it's a pretty neat place. definitely worth checking out
The Spiffy Fox,5,"Service:  GoodRestroom:. CleanFood: excellentI tried the cheese breads, the spring mix, and the following pizzas:Spicy PieTriple PThe FoxMargheritaThe crust and other ingredients were very good.  The pineapple was caramelized, which made for an unconventional pairing with the pork.  I'll get the triple P with a red or spicy sauce next time."
The Spiffy Fox,4,"Very good pizza and good service. The tables are a bit small and the space is a little tight, but it was a good dining experience."
The Spiffy Fox,1,"Whoever said ""there's no such thing as bad pizza"" needs to eat here. Tried it on a whim. Ordered The Cheesemonger, their weekly special. It was a disappointment to all of us. I got lured in by the ""mozzarella and two Irish cheeses"" line so imagine my surprise when I got a super thin crust that tasted like cheddar cheese. The ""pub fries"" aren't bad but, really, it takes a special kind of moron to screw up frozen fries. The Jilly Pie, I had hope for. Granny Smith apples, mascarpone, it sounded amazing. It was the most bland dessert pie we've ever tasted. I sit writing this while half the pizza and 3/4 of the dessert are sitting in the kitchen. I could've walked to Ashland Pub, spent the same amount of money, and gotten a far superior meal. This is the most depressed a pizza place had left me since Mellow in Midtown closed. The staff was excellent. I can say that with the utmost sincerity. I just can't believe what I ate is indicative of what this place does given the rest of their reviews and their rating. I have to wonder if I just caught them on a bad night but I'm not risking my money again to find out."
The Spiffy Fox,5,"Most excellent pizza, which is a big deal for Mobile.  Great flavors and a very crisp while delicate crust.  It's a new favorite."
The Spiffy Fox,5,"Excellent. By far the best pizza downtown! The pizza has a nice crunch and the cheese tastes fresh. During the week they have  an excellent and affordable personal pizza, salad, plus drink. The waiter was attentive and friendly. This places rocks! Try it!"
The Spiffy Fox,4,"I want to love this place, I really do. The reason they only got four stars was because of the customer service. It looks like they're not quite up and running yet so I will be back and try them out again when they're more established. We ordered our pizza ahead of time, when we got there there was a very young girl sitting at the counter, eating pizza, waiting to take our money so we could grab our pizza and go. The phone rang, she told us to hold on, took that order and then came back to us. We wanted to know if we could split the total 50-50 but she didn't think that was possible so we just divided up later. I understand it's a family business but things do need to be a little bit more professional than this was. She's young so she gets a pass but someone  needs to step it up a bit as far as friendliness and customer service goes. Now I did think the girl was sweet she just seemed a little overwhelmed and like she wasn't quite ready for a job yet. I didn't think badly of her at all. just thought it was kind of a weird way to do business.As for the pizza I thought it was very tasty. We got a veggie, a meaty and the sweet pork. The crust was super yummy too. Everybody especially liked the meaty one best. We had some leftover and threw it in the oven for a few minutes and it was fabulous the next day too. I think once they get properly situated this is going to be a great place to hang out."
The Spiffy Fox,4,Spicy pizza was good- so was the Cesar salad. No liquor license yet although I can tell they will serve some good craft options from the ambiance of the place when they do get approved. Homemade Ranch dressing that we had on the side was not good at all. Cool place seems convenient for takeout as well.
The Spiffy Fox,5,"My family and I were happy to hear that The Spiffy Fox Pub has soft opened their dining room.  We have enjoyed the pizza via delivery, but we had never been inside before today.  My family of 5 arrived shortly after 5 pm.  The dining room was about half full.  There is a clear Scots-Irish theme. A waitress invited us to select an empty table.  It's clear that the process of opening remains underway.  Our waitress let us know that eventually there will be a fully stocked bar with a large whiskey selection.  She also let us know the coffee maker has been ordered but had not yet been delivered.  It's ice tea and soft drinks only at this stage.  Coca Cola is available in glass bottles.  We started with a large order (12) of garlic knots and ordered a Margherita Pizza to follow.  The garlic knots had crispy exteriors, steaming and chewy in the middle.  Very good.  There was a lot of flavor of Parmesan and another cheese that was stretchy.   While enjoying the cheese knots our pile of toddlers grew more unruly than the other diners should be expected to tolerate, and we asked for the pizza to be put in a box to go.  We are thankful our waitress Lindsey was so tolerant of and helpful with our overtired children when it was time to herd them into the car.Back at home I was very happy with the pizza.  It was totally traditional other than having more sauce than would be found on a pizza Margherita in Italy.  The sauce was very good as was the New York style crust. I'm abstaining from meat due to a gout flare up.  As soon as it has passed, I cannot wait to return and try some of the other items on offer."
The Spiffy Fox,5,"This place is AMAZING. We tried the Cheesy Bread as an appetizer and it was obviously delicious because my family demolished it before I could get a picture. Great Pizza, BYOB (only beer and wine), and great atmosphere. I hate to knock Mellow, but the Spicy Pie at Spiffy Fox, knocks the pants off their Mighty Meaty. ‍ (kid friendly) TRY THIS PLACE!!"
The Spiffy Fox,4,"Good pizza, atmosphere was a little bland, conversations were awesome.I loved the music, being my family is pretty Irish obsessed. I swear to god the owners were being possessed by some Irish spirits or something. The pizza though was really good!!! I would live to try some other pies and desserts and stuff, but the wallet had the best of us, right now.As for the atmosphere, it was cute, but it could use a little more authenticity. (If you guys are going for an Irish pub style, I would recommend getting some GAA stuff and hanging that. Not to mention, there are a plethora of taps you guys can get that at pretty Irish.) Still I loved it and you guys were great, always love a good conversation, it was awesome since it was, I think, it was the owners."
The Hummingbird Way,5,"THW is delicious! Chef Jim does a great job, and also pivoted nicely with to-go orders brought on by Covid-19. I'm partial to brunch and the biscuit service, but the flavors are pretty outstanding here. Order whatever you want, it'll be great! As the restaurant formerly known as Kitchen on George, it took me 2 visits to really get a good feel, but I'm bought in and they've got their beverage menu laid out nicely. Although currently temporarily closed, I'm truly hoping THW weathers this storm."
The Hummingbird Way,5,Service and food were exceptional !!We are from Texas and love eating at new restaurant!!The biscuits are some of the best I have ever had .
The Hummingbird Way,5,"This was our first visit to The Hummingbird Way and we are already looking forward to returning again when we can!  Above all else, the food was delicious and left us wanting to try more items on the menu. We started with raw oysters (they're sold individually) which were very fresh and served with both a vinaigrette and cocktail sauce. We also had the biscuits off the starters menu and they are a must-have! The biscuits are served with butter, flake salt, and syrup, and they are Heaven. For dinner, I had the grouper with bacon consommé. The grouper was cooked perfectly and was so delicious over the navy beans with the bacon consommé poured over it all. My husband had the whole grilled pompano, which was as impressive looking as it was delicious. To finish we shared a piece of pecan pie that was probably the best I've ever had. Our service at the bar and by our waiter was excellent. There was a bit of a wait for our table (even with a reservation), but that's to be expected at a brand new restaurant that's gaining popularity while also still working the kinks out. It was absolutely worth the wait."
The Hummingbird Way,5,"My husband and son treated me to dinner. I had the tasting menu with Duck Confit. It was amazing! The Chef came out at the end of service. Very personable and talented. Do yourself a huge favor, have dinner here!!"
The Hummingbird Way,4,"I feel more like 3.5 stars but I will follow the laws of math and round it up to 4. I also feel that this place has a great 5 star potential. This is an edited and updated review. Since Ipublished my review, the chef -Owner contacted me and offered an explanation to some of our table's concerns. So, Here's our table's collective opinion : Food -- flavor 5/5. Everything our table ordered tasted good and was top quality. Crab claws were some of the best. Everything was prepared expertly, and we would have rated this restaurant 5 stars, had the service been on top of things. Service 2/5 -- one of us received a wrong beverage and sat with it for almost 10 minutes before the waitress showed up again, and we could tell her about it. Two wine glasses and a water sat empty for at least 5 minutes before they got refilled. When the waitress finally showed up, she did not even know where to position herself in order to replenish my wine glass. The waiter taking care of the table beside ours never even glanced in our direction. Several wait staff walked by and not a single person even paid attention to our empty glasses. The culture in the dining room was basically "" not my table, not my problem"". And this is where I want to get to my deleted point. The value. Originally, Our table criticized the price points, but having heard the chef's comments about his commitment to sustainability and keeping things local and fresh, and having considered price points at other fine dining places we patron here in Mobile and in New Orleans, we realized that it is not the prices we are so salty about, it is the feeling that we got short changed and did not receive what we paid for. It all goes back to lack of service and lack of dining experience. The kitchen did their job. No complaints there. But at the price points, we expected our dinner to be an experience; this restaurant is not a run in and grab a bite type of place. And they absolutely failed us in that; so this is where "" we did not get what we paid for"" Comment comes from. We truly feel like we didn't. Would we go back ? We definitely want to give their brunch a try. If the food is as delicious and the service is improved, I will happily upgrade my review to 5/5."
The Hummingbird Way,4,"Very pleased with our recent visit!  Prompt seating and excellent service.  We had a reservation for 3 at 5:15 and it was just starting to fill up as we were leaving.  The biscuit service was delicious (4 warm biscuits served with whipped butter, syrup, and smoked salt).  We had the seafood platter with blackened shrimp, seafood platter with fried shrimp, and roasted oyster mushrooms with sweet potato and boiled peanuts.  Everything was very good!  Looking forward to trying the brunch sometime, but I'd like to see a vegetarian option or seafood options sans oysters (I know, it's an oyster bar...)"
The Hummingbird Way,5,"Visited my grandmother in Mobile and decided to check out this new-ish spot. It was amazing!!! All five of us loved our meals, which included oysters, biscuit service (must order!), carrot soup, chicken pot pie (amazing), hanger steak, quail, and more! Waiter was great and chef came out to say hi a few times as well. Nothing bad to say about this spot!"
The Hummingbird Way,5,Delicious fresh grouper cooked to perfection. So convenient smack dab on George Street. The wait staff was attentive and helpful in our selections. Can't wait to make this a frequent stop for our family!
The Hummingbird Way,5,Delicious fresh and local food and a menu that changes frequently. Great selection of wine and many to choose from. I recommend making a reservation as walk in times are long.
The Hummingbird Way,5,"We've been lamenting the loss of our beloved Kitchen on George since it left this spot last year. However, The Hummingbird Way absolutely filled this neighborhood space with a restaurant that is equally dedicated to quality and service! We had the fried oyster appetizer with an omelette to begin. The combination of items was a little weird, but the big take away was that these people can fry! We're definitely going to try their friend seafood platter next time. The oysters themselves were out of this world. We then had the carrot soup (sounds weird but it's a must-get) and the grilled wedge salad. They were both excellent. For dinner, we split the pork chop entree. I'm not big on pork, but it was delicious. The accoutrements were particularly excellent - loved the cabbage. Finally, dessert: the pot de creme and the chocolate chip cookie were UNREAL. I'll probably be returning just to eat dessert. Our dinner was a little pricier than we would have liked, however we did splurge on a few things like cocktails and fancy glasses of wine. Not something we can do every week. Nevertheless, we are SO HAPPY that this awesome restaurant has come to our neighborhood. There is no doubt that we will be back!"
The Hummingbird Way,5,"This location has been several recent popular incarnations.  It is in the center of a popular historic neighborhood.  It's a great venue and we always liked to simply go to their bar area and get drinks.  The chef worked as the chef for the governor of Alabama and I believe won Iron Chef? Anyway, my husband had the chicken livers  which the waitress said was his winning dish.  He also had duck and oyster gumbo- excellent!! We also had a starter of crab Rangoon. I had the Vidalia onion and Mirlitot soup with a pear salad.  Mine was good but I think my husband's was probably  the best.  Then we shared hummingbird cake.  It was just a great meal.  My only complaint is they need some cheaper Prosecco! It's $12 a glass! Too much!  I see they have a  brunch on Sunday and that is their only lunch meal.  I look forward to trying it.  The menu is unusually heavy on seafood but that is not a bad thing.  Not your typical seafood menu either.  Make sure you have a reservation- it's not a super huge restaurant."
The Hummingbird Way,5,Extemely excited about this new restaurant in mobile! The chef has really amazing dishes that are unique. The wine list is also super impressive and clearly thought through before being added to the menu. Would definitely recommended trying out this new and exciting restaurant!
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,Let start off by saying WOW! This place had me shocked! It was professional but also was very amazing in the customer service aspect. 1. Let me just say I have never seen a pizza place take the food out to the persons car for them. OR hold the doors open for them. 2. They gratuitously answer any questions that you have in a timely and professional manner. They treat everyone who enters like family. You feel very welcomed almost like you are visiting an old friend. That old friend is joe! The owner. He was spectacular not only was he kind and considerate he gave us everything we asked for a more.So now onto the food! For the price and the size? It is completely unbeatable! They do a wonderful pizza. It really does make you feel like your in New York! Me and my girlfriend loved the food and will be coming back soon as regulars! If you get a chance to go to this wonderful pizza and pasta I would HIGHLY recommend best iv come across so far!
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,"Simply the best pizza I've tried in Mobile County! New York style pizza at it's finest. My wife and I had the lunch combo ""2 slices and a drink for $7.00"". We both had 1 slice of the pepperoni and 1 slice of the white. Go there and check it out for yourselves. We also ordered a cannoli which amazing!"
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,"Took me two years, but I finally found Giuseppe (Joe) after he had to move his business from Spanish Fort. While I can no longer just jump off I-10 on the way to the Florida beaches, I will certainly be tempted to do so because the pepperoni pizza was as good as ever. And now bigger than ever--28"".  The four cheese slice was really good. Stuffed pizza slice was super filling, but just ok.  Joe, as always, was friendly. Wish he was in Baton Rouge."
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,"Oh my! What a delicious PIZZA  Thanks to all of the elite Yelpers who reviewed this pizza place - we followed your lead. Called toGo as this location does not have tables toeat in. Ordered the 18"" pizza thank the Lord we did not ordered the HUGE 28"" - I would have had to call all my family and friends over to to finish that size off. Sides:Ordered the sausage rolls the meat Calzone2 garlic rolls2 cannoliThe best pizza in Mobile- Joe was so friendly over the phone and even more so in person. He had customers drive over from Bay Minette - I vote for a sit down place to open up over here by me and the new South stadium - PLEASE!!"
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,"So... I've watched Joe's Pizza & Pasta creep up the ladder of local faves and at this point, I've made 3 visits and completed one take out order. I can say that the best part of my Joe's experiences is the consistent quality of their pizza! Sidebar: Joe is the nicest guy and makes ordering easy! He's usually working and has a great rapport with customers. The 4 cheese pizza is definitely made by Joe (and the angels of heaven)-- it's SO good and my personal favorite. The lunch special is perfect (great price and huge portion). All in all, three cheers for Joe's!"
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,"Yes please! The pizza is Amazing!!! Super sweet staff!We tried a build your own with ricotta, basil and pepperoni. Yum!!!!We will be back, Joe! Don't you worry!!"
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,"I truly think this is one of the best pizza places in Mobile. It's about a 20 minute drive from my house so to pick it up and bring it back home again is quite the trip but very much worth it.The size of the smallest pie is huge. One of their smallest pizzas fed four of us to the point of being stuffed. I love the ricotta cheese pizza... sometimes I think about it at night. It has some sort of a tang to it that I can't get enough of. The crust is deliciously flavorful (get some marinara to dip it in for an extra treat.) Calories don't matter when it comes to this pizza, just do it! My friends love their plain pepperoni pizza, they say it's their favorite in Mobile pizza as well.I wish I had pictures to share but I was too excited and ate it before I remembered."
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,4,"Had joes for the first time over the weekend and it's pretty good pizza! Didn't order any of their specialty type pizzas, but next time I will probably try one. I chose this place because of the great reviews and it didn't disappoint. On a Friday night Joe's was a busy place to get pizza, so you'll definitely want to order 40min or so ahead of the time that you'd like to pick it up or be prepared for a wait. I thought the toppings were good, crust was a little tough, not in the burnt kind of way though (weird, I know). All in all we were pleased with our pizza and will give Joes another visit at some point."
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,"Do yourself a favor and get the Quattro Formaggi. It's hard to describe but it has the perfect blend of cheeses and a nice, chewy crust that just makes for a really great pie. But anything you order here should be good. I've had the baked ziti, pepperoni pizza, and lasagna. No complaints on any of it. You can tell the ingredients are fresh. I believe sausage is used in the meat sauce, so note that if you're not a fan of sausage. The crust is thin and foldable, and has a chewy texture. It's not cracker thin. Next up I want to try their carbonara. It's one of my favorite dishes but I've been hesitant to try it. After three pleasant experiences, I'll give it a go."
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,Fantastic delicious pizza and even better people that own the places. They are so kind and when you walk in the door you feel welcomed like family we will definitely be back to Joes best pizza I've had in a very long time.
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,4,The food here is good and the staff is so friendly and helpful.amd u wanna talk about smelling good omg I just wanted to sit there and breathe in all the yummy goodness.i will be going back
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,3,"Just because something is big, doesn't make it better. Yes, the portions are outrageous, but I wasn't highly impressed. I am a crust and sauce kind of girl and I don't feel like this pizza had that for me. There was a ton of cheese, no doubt, but where was my zest in some sauce? The 3 meat pie we ordered looked kinda lifeless because it had no sauce no jazz to lift it up. If I decide to try it again, I'll order a calzone or something and see how that goes."
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,I was in Mobile for a work trip and saw this restaurant. It was a little far but worth the drive! Soooo good!
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,"I never tried Joe's in Spanish Fort. That was a mistake. Now I know why everybody is still mad he moved. Dear god... the last pizza I ate (from another place) made me hate pizza. It tasted like 9/11 felt, but Joe's is amazing. I ordered it yesterday on my way home. It wasn't on my way. I went out of my way and I will gladly do so again. We got the Quattro, or as my wife called it, The Cheese Orgy. It was beautiful. It tasted like nothing I've ever had on a pizza. This is life changing pie. Everything is fresh. The dough. The cheese. I can't get over how excellent this pizza was. I can't wait to order another one. I wanna see what Joe can do with toppings because this was pizza in its more pure form. It was artistry. It was even good this morning, out of the microwave because I woke up too late to pop it in a cast iron skillet. There better be some left when I get home today. That's how good it was."
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,2,I don't know... it's just not my favorite. I got the lunch special slice and it was just ok.
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,"The best, the best, the best.I lived in Chicago for ten years.  And Joe's is the best.I have eaten a lot of pizza in my life, and Joe's is the best.No wonder he was rated as the best pizza in Alabama, and I'd put him toe to toe with ANYBODY, ANYWHERE.We had the stuffed pizza.  Now I can usually eat a reasonably sized pizza by myself.  But this monster was so big (not to mention delicious) that I could only eat two slices.  And I was STUFFED!If you have never had Joe's pizza, write this down:  You're missing out!  Go find out what real pizza is.  See you there, because we'll be back again and again.And did I mention it's the best?"
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,Tried it for the first time and I got to admit this is my new go to place for my pie. One of the best pizza I had in Alabama.
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,"I live in West Mobile and Joe's is one of my go-to places. Super tasty pizza and calzones that are warm and ready to be picked up at lunch or dinner. Don't need to wait longer than five minutes without even calling ahead, and they always have a lot of different types ready (e.g. four cheese, meat lover, etc.). I always choose it over the fast food at the Winn-Dixie."
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,This was our first time trying Joe's and it exceeded our expectations.  Ordered over the phone with ease and picked up. It was a huge pizza and it was hot and delicious.  The tiramisu was some of the best that I have had in years.  Will definitely be back to try the calzones and the cannoli. I noticed a sign where they have a lunch special everyday until 4pm that gets you 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $7 after tax .
Joe’s Pizza & Pasta,5,"Out from Cali and wanted some good pizza. Checked on Yelp for good pizza in Mobile and Joe's came up and had 5 stars. Read a few reviews and decided to give them a try. Got a 20"" and AntiPasta. Great food! Thanks!"
Pizzeria Delphina,5,The Cadillac pizza is the best in town. The Greek salad is awesome. And last but not least the mussels and shrimp pasta is so good all dishes are authentic and hand made with passion
Pizzeria Delphina,4,"A small hole in the wall type pizza & pasta joint with lots of cute character. Menu covers your typical pizza place, includes salads, pastas calzones and pizza.The pizza itself wasn't the best I've ever had nor was it the worst. I'd probably have to call it average I guess, but not sure how many times that I would have it again.Service was fast, as was getting the pizza to go. Next time I'll probably try  another item off the menu and maybe pizza too."
Pizzeria Delphina,4,"I ordered a small pizza with sausage. The crust was very good and well cooked. The home made sausage added a delicious taste. The serving size was enough for 2 people to each have 3 genius slices. The price was 11.00 shared, so a pretty good deal. This was also during the thick of Mardi Gras and did not take long to prepare. Thumbs up for the Pizza :)"
Pizzeria Delphina,5,"I've always wanted to come here but.....Well, everyone in my house is not a fan of Italian Cuisine.   Certain things yes.   But it has to be prepared just right.  Looks like they passed the test.  My 15 year old said the pizza was fabulous.  What does she know about pizza?Go figure.  I had the meatball Calzone with extra sauce , cheese and red pepper flakes.  I could not stop eating it.  Washed it down with some strawberry cake.  And get this.....with me and my party of 3 teenagers and 3 kids, we were only $7 more than my ChickFilA order.  Whereby my mobile app order crashed and burned for the ChickFilA option.  But that's another story.  And don't get me started on Subway nearby.  Dude!!!!So glad we went Italian."
Pizzeria Delphina,4,"Great hole-in-the-wall Italian join downtown. Very casual, laid back place with a handful of patio tables. I ordered the Greek salad (which came with feta and shredded cheddar cheese?) which was decently sized for a small salad, with a giant scoop of olive salad on top. Good if you love olives!For my main I had the pasta primavera which was a huge portion for a small (they also have a large option), and had plenty of fresh slices of zucchini. There was too much olive oil, but it had a nice flavor and will make a nice lunch tomorrow! Pizzas and calzones look solid but the pastas and salads looked the best from what I observed. Service was just ok but pretty efficient. The bar selections are limited to a few beers and wines, but definitely enough to wash down a hearty, carby meal. Will definitely be back for a quick bite."
Pizzeria Delphina,5,"Whoa, this pizza's good! The hubs and I came in for a late-ish bite on a Sunday night. (Ooh-- that rhymed! lol)PD is small and quaint, and packs a huge punch! I asked the guy in the back rolling and tossing the dough (not my server) for his recommendation, and went with it. He said that the sausage was his personal favorite, so that's what I ordered. I got the sausage with onions and green peppers. --YUM! Hubs did the sausage as well (in true copycat fashion after eavesdropping) and added pepperoni to his. His pizza was great also-- we swapped a slice. We also tried the meatball appetizer and it was delicious! All in all, my first PD visit was awesome and certainly won't be my last! Sidebar, I love the artwork on the walls."
Pizzeria Delphina,4,"Pizza on the Beach!We stopped here for a Togo order on our way to New Orleans and pulled off on a random beach to enjoy it! Taste:  4 Stars We ordered a medium Pepperoni Pizza and added Jalapeños and Pineapple. (Our favorite pizza combination). It was pretty good, but not the best we've ever had. Service: 5 Stars This was a takeout order but there was very friendly & welcoming staff. Price: 3 Stars $20 for a Medium Pizza with 3 toppings. Not bad for a non-branch pizza place but still pricey. Overall: 4 Stars I can't really speak for the restaurant's quality outside of the food itself but the pizza really hit the spot during our 8 hour drive from Atlanta to New Orleans! Melissa St.Clair Atlanta Native"
Pizzeria Delphina,1,"Filthy filthy filthy if you have an issue with servers being sanitary or the restaurant you are eating clean don't come here if you want any sense of the word service again DON'T COME HERE. We ordered a half sausage and the other half with just Vegetables ""we got"" a Whole sausage with almost no veggies look for my picture you'll get the idea. We ordered a house salad never came basically we sat at the bar and watch servers using their dirty hands to scoop ice into drink glasses while using the same hands to scrape food off of plates they cleared from the tables into the trash. hands down they win the most disgusting restaurant award"
Pizzeria Delphina,5,"In my world, you don't get 10/10 for being perfect. You get 10/10 for being awesome. My buddy and I dropped in here on a random Saturday. We started off sharing a Greek salad with Gorgonzola dressing. Wow what great flavor!! And even a small was enough to share as a starter. Then we shared a large Cadillac pizza. OMG this has amazing flavor, well balanced mix of cheese, crispy crust, and tasty toppings. One of few pizzas I have had that needs no stuff sprinkled on top- excellent as is. And save that leftover Gorgonzola dressing to dip the crust in.   Mmmmmmmm what a winner!"
Pizzeria Delphina,5,"Went to Pizzaria Delphina for lunch today. We had the le cadillac pizza. I am telling you, this is the absolute best pizza I have had since moving to the Mobile area 17 years ago. The staff is delightful. Mr. Gambino makes the homemade crusts every day and makes his own mozzarella. DELICIOUS!!!"
Pizzeria Delphina,1,"This place is garbage.  Staff is terrible at best.  The lady running the place today kicked us out because we called in our order.  We all sat down to dine but because we called ahead they told us they have a no dining policy.  Oh by the way, we all tipped over 20 percent before they told us but saw it fit to keep the cash.  Here's the deal when it comes to the pie, it's like a 5 outta 10. Has barely any sauce so expect heavy cheese only.  The crust is super doughy and not a good pizza crisp.  So imagine a slightly better Lil Caesars.  But also expect a side of ""we will whack you if you don't leave"" if you happen to call your order ahead.  With all the tip money they took from us they aren't too far off from being extortionists."
Pizzeria Delphina,1,"By the way, if you leave a negative review, the owner will more than likely send you nasty messages like he did with me. Just a heads up!Edit: Alright, Mr. Gambino. I'm sorry you didn't agree with my review. I've posted what you obviously thought was the appropriate way to respond to my review. You can continue responding however you wish. Your customers will see that and the way you conduct your business. I wont continue to argue with you. Have a nice day."
Pizzeria Delphina,4,"We ordered take out as the place was small and with it being Saturday night....it was really busy and we were really hungry.  Our hotel was only a couple blocks away, so we figured our meal wouldn't suffer much during transport.  Love love the fact that you can order their specialty pastas in two sizes.  The pollo alla vodka was calling our name with chicken, mushroom tomato, vodka, and a splash of cream.  The poultry was super tender, the sauce perfectly balanced and the al dente pasta made this dish a treat.  I rarely order cream sauce pasta dishes, as they often end up being just a soupy mess.  But after seeing photos, I decided on taking a risk on the gamberetto di Alfredo.  Seriously, if I ever crave superior comfort food I will reminisce about this dish.  The plump jumbo shrimp, the sweet butter, cream and the salty, nutty grana padana parmigiana,  made our hearts and palates swoon.  The smaller servings were still incredibly generous and unfortunately some of this wonderful pasta had to be left behind as we continued our road trip.  We did order a calzone, but after sampling our entrees it was difficult to even concentrate on the behemoth dough stuffed with sausage, cheese and ham. The separate marinara sauce that accompanied it, tasted too sweet to me, so that meal was basically left untouched. It was well executed just not to our personal preferences.  In the end it didn't matter, as the pasta dishes were the super stars and our taste buds and stomachs were lovingly satiated."
Pizzeria Delphina,1,Disgusting is where I need to start off. So we had the older male gentleman Who had started off serving us everything seem to be fine from the beginning my husband orders the spaghetti and meatball large which he absolutely loved. And then it was my turn to order the server had suggested I order the carbonara I had told him to begin with I was not a huge carbonara type of person that I was more so on the alla vodka side. He says no no no you will love this it's my favorite it's the best so I go ahead and order it. The carbonara comes out and it's more on the Alfredo side if I wanted the consistency of fettuccine Alfredo I would have ordered fettuccine Alfredo. So I took two bites of my food and wound up sharing with my husband. The server comes back around and says I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I pushed you to order that I'm going to take care of you mind you I didn't hardly eat any of my food two bites to be exact. So he gives us the military discount off the total bill which it was my husband his coworker and myself so the total taken off the bill was $7. The server then mentions to the manager what had happened and she didn't come over to our table apologize nothing. My meal should have been totally comped and he could have eaten it himself since he pushed me so hard to order the carbonara. Just wanted to let everyone know buyer beware!!!
Pizzeria Delphina,5,Excellent food. Always fresh. A welcoming and friendly wait staff. I've eaten here several times and the food is consistently great.
Pizzeria Delphina,4,"Delphina!!! Almost like SF. Missing some menu items, pizza crust isn't as delish, but it was still great. We were excited to see it in Mobile!"
Pizzeria Delphina,5,"I've only had the pizza so far , pepperoni is my favorite . The wife ordered the combo style pizza it was good too . Wish I lived closer ..."
Pizzeria Delphina,5,"Our experience at Pizzeria Delphina is best summarized by the following pizza haiku, also known as a pie-ku: Pizza Ben AffleckWe ordered the CadillacNext night, we went back.Now, for the inspo behind the pie-ku:We tumbled into Pizzeria Delphina one Friday evening after a stiff drink at The Hab. We were in Mobile for a weekend getaway and needed carbs to make it through the night. It's a small joint, more dimly lit than a pizza parlor but not quite dark enough to be posh. The tables were loaded, so we made a beeline for the open bar. Don't expect ""just a slice"" after 3:00 pm. You'll have to pony up and get a small, but it's worth it. We respect their likely intention to deter the late-night drunks. We got the Cadillac and a couple Fat Tires. The pizza's fantastic, toppings tasty, crust just right (sorry for the lack of photo evidence, but you know what good pizza looks like). The customer service makes the pie even better. Pro tip: Trade ranch for caesar dressing. It didn't take long to realize the crew is nothing like Fast Times at Ridgemont High--they're living the Life of Pie. They've all got great stories if you're willing to ask the right questions. If you're not, you'll at least enjoy some rad pizza. Two hours later, we felt like family. Check out our family portrait... never mind the smoldering look from local celeb, #PizzaBenAffleck. Pizzeria Delphina is unassuming and genuine. Some might say it's at the end of Dauphin Street, but we think it's more like the beginning. Pizza be with you, #PizzaBenAffleck."
Pizzeria Delphina,2,"We were in town for an extremely large sorority conference. The food and service from Jamie was outstanding. However, Summer, another waitress, tainted our experience with her rude, nasty, non customer service attitude! She never smiled! She asked some paying customers that met us there to get up because she had people waiting. The only people standing were 2 people waiting on a to go order. She caused us to finish our meal prematurely and GTHO.Management should address this foul behavior since this is a tourist stop!"
Pizzeria Delphina,5,"This is one of the places that you visit out of town and you can only be thankful you don't live nearby. We were just walking trying to figure out what to eat for lunch when this place was suggested. I wasn't impressed because I wasn't sure I wanted something from a ""pizzeria""... Thank goodness we just stopped in to take a look at the menu--then sat right on down. I split the shrimp scampi with my sister and we each ordered the Greek salads. Both were really delicious and we wished we had gotten the full portion of scampi. A friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs which was also a great selection. I'm always funny about meatballs but these were tender and juicy and the sauce was equally as delightful. But the showstopper was the garlic bread... my, my, my... We instantly ordered more at first taste! We felt so accomplished finding such a gem by chance. Definitely the place to go if I'm ever given another opportunity visiting Mobile."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,5,"While home I wanted Oysters and all manner seafood! And of course my first stop is one of the oldest seafood restaurants in Mobile. I get there and the place is the same but if you've been doing this for as long as Wintzell's you pretty much have it down to a Science. The menu gives you a cross-section of Southern, Cajun and Creole foods. It's not the Cheesecake Factory but it's a sizable menu. I started with a dozen Raw Oysters (just what you expect from Gulf Oysters.......simply the best) and Fried Green Tomatoes(the Whistle Stop Cafe could not have done better); they brought both out at the same time for some unknown reason.  Next I ordered some Sautéed Crab Claws; she brought those out before clearing the table of the other two dishes. The Claws were De-Lici-Ous as always! Then I had a cup of Gumbo that was pretty good; I mean it's not mine (meaning my father's recipe) but it was good. I would normally take off a star or two for the not so great service but I know this is a rare occasion for Wintzell's Oyster House; at least I hope so. Yes, the ol'place doesn't seem the same since Mr. Willlie's passing......but that Old Mobile Charm is still there."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,4,"Was in town for Mardi Gras and everyone we talked to recommended we head to Wintzell's.Wintzell's has a cute vibe, with aphorisms posted in different colored papers all over the restaurant. We had the oyster sampler (total of 16 oysters prepared in 4 different ways: oysters Monterey, oysters bienville, oysters Rockefeller, and chargrilled oysters). Essentially they were chargrilled oysters, jalapeño BBQ cheddar cheese covered oysters, oysters with spinach + cheese, &  oysters with Parmesan cheese, lots of butter, and small shrimps.  We also got the cream of crab of soup and an order of fried dill pickles.The oyster sample was great but I would pass on the appetizers."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,5,"Just had oysters 5 days in a row in the Mobile area, and Wintzell's was the best.  Everything on the menu that we had was excellent.  Lately so many restaurants are trying to sell this imported Swai or Basa or other Chinese or Vietnamese imported fresh water fish thinking their customers won't know.  Wintzell's doesn't do this.  This was a local saltwater fish, just excellent.  If they are going to serve you a freshwater catfish, they call it catfish. Awesome batter, perfectly cooked, some of the best fried fish I have ever had.  Fisherman's fried platter is HUGE.Had a dozen happy hour $1 oysters too.  Happy hour $3 and $4 beers.Great place.  If you are in Mobile, you have to stop here."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,5,"The best oysters I've ever had is all I have to say!!!! This was my first time visiting Alabama and I was led right to this gem. I ordered the $5 drink special of the day which was a watermelon margarita on the rocks. For my meal I had the oyster sampler which was 4 different types of oysters and 4 of them each making it a total of 16. The 4 types was chargrilled (butter and cheese), Rockefeller (spinach and cheese), Monterey (Monterey cheese, bacon, and jalapeños), and bienville (shrimp, crab meat, and Parmesan cheese). For $24 you can't beat that AT ALL!!! And they were literally the best oysters I've ever had. All their food is priced great for the amount of food that you get. And service is good as well.Whenever in Mobile I'll be sure to make this my first stop."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,4,"This oyster house hit the spot for me and my dad! Thank you for the amazing service Maurice! I ordered a dozen oysters, crab cakes, and gumbo. My gumbo was very good and so were my char grilled and spinach oysters! My father ordered the salmon which he ate all of so I imagine it was good! My crab cakes  were not that great, so I did not finish them. Other than that everything else was great!"
Wintzell’s Oyster House,4,Good restaurant with tons to read on the historic walls.  Literally!!!Seafood is outstanding.  Cooked to order.  With a pleasant staff.  Irma did a great job.  Ask for her. Here are some of the oysters that we ordered.
Wintzell’s Oyster House,5,"So glad we stopped in before our cruise. The oyster sampler was amazing. We loved all of them, so it's hard to pick a favorite. The oysters were huge. They were even better than the ones I've had in New Orleans or other oceanfront towns. Hubby got the fish with sides. The sauce that came with the fish was amazing. It was so creamy with a ton of flavor. The fried okra was delicious. I got the shrimp tacos. I liked the seasoning and the slaw it came with. Since the portions are huge, I suggest sharing if you aren't super hungry. The service was great. He had helpful suggestions and even swapped out sides when he found out it had pork in it (pescatarian diet for me)."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,5,"I love this place, last summer was my first time at this location, HANNAH was our server and she was great! I'm not sure if she's still here or not. This weekend I had the great pleasure to visit Mobile again and experience another great serverDAVID. DAVID was very attentive and friendly. I looked around and saw every server smiling and enjoying their jobs serving everyone with a smile, even the ones who were not serving us spoked and smiled at us too. Such a warm environment. My main reason for coming to the area was to visit friends and eat fresh delicious seafood. This is the place we chose to eat our seafood because everytime we're in town we come here because the seafood is always fresh and the staff is always friendly. I've also dine at their other location in town on Airport Blvd. however this one has become my favorite. Their is a very entertaining backdrop as soon as you walk through the doors with all the notes of witty puns and quotes hand written all over the walls. You will definitely get caught up laughing at each one of them. We ordered a half dozen of the Bienville Oysters which  had shrimp and cream sauce on top of them. They were so delicious we ordered a second order. We also ordered the Rockefeller Oysters which are made with spinach on top. Both selections were scrumptious. We also ordered buffalo wings which were good too. The showstopper for me was the homemade bread pudding with a delicate sauce, I believed was a rum sauce. Every bite was to die for. The very next evening we came here again this time for oysters and crab legs. The crab legs were smaller than I like however big on flavor, I had them with steamed broccoli. I can't wait to visit here again!"
Wintzell’s Oyster House,4,"Second time here. LOVE the oysters. Had the oyster sampler to share. Not disappointed. Love the atmosphere. Our server, Pinky, was all things fabulous!! Next time I make it back to Mobile you can bet I will be stopping here for some delicious oysters."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,4,"During a work trip to Biloxi, my husband and I had a free afternoon for a side excursion. I've never been to Alabama before, so it only seemed appropriate to head to Mobile for a few hours.  And I don't know why we chose Wintzell's for lunch, but omg, soooo glad we did!We started with an appetizer and split the fried green tomatoes with crawfish sauce. This had very good flavor, tasted very ""southern-y"" like okra. We're not experts, but we think they were hand breaded. Pretty sure, anyway. Regardless - delicious! Then we shared 6 Carnival oysters topped with crab, spinach and a hollandaise-type sauce (although could've actually been hollandaise). Hubby said it was the one of the best grilled oysters he's ever had.For our meal, he chose the crab claw basket. It was served in a butter sauce perfect for dipping in your garlic toast. Very addicting - he couldn't stop eating them. I snuck a few bites, never having crab claws before. They were good!  I had the Shrimp and Grits, which were good. Lots of small shrimp and what looked like the crawfish sauce in the center. Flavorful! Not my favorite version, but I enjoyed it very much.We had a very friendly server, and service was quick. The restaurant is kind of dive-y but oh so good. Excellent lunch y'all. A must do."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,5,We went with a group on a Sunday afternoon. We had a good size group around 11. The service was quick. I ordered the shrimp poboy with fries and it was huge and amazing. I would absolutely order that again. Others got the catfish poboy and it was huge also. Kids like these chickens and fries. Also other got the gumbo and said it was great. We will be back if we are in he area
Wintzell’s Oyster House,4,"Food was good. Heavily seasoned. The chargrilled oysters are ""you like them or ya don't"" kinda thing. Shrimp n' grits has creole sauce on top that was crazy good. Server was efficient. Would definitely go back."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,4,"Everything was very good and the service was quick and friendly.  My friend ordered the fish tacos and said they were a bit on the spicy side but she still enjoyed them.... Just a warning for anyone that can't handle spice. Her husband ordered the seafood Alfredo and enjoyed it very much. My husband ordered a bowl of gumbo which he said was tasty and I ordered the crab bisque. It was all good. However, I was a bit surprised at the very small portion of soup in the bowl size. It was maybe 1/2"" deep... MAYBE. I would hate to see how much is in the cup size. My husband and I had a late lunch that day so we were not starving which is why we only ordered a bowl of soup each. We were still hungry after eating and got to hunt down some dessert. I guess we won after all."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,4,"Hands down the best fried fish and shrimp dinners I've had in quite some time! The fish with hot, well coated, tasty, and crispy. The small was a little bit runny, but had a great flavor. There was a ton of french fries with it. Hush puppies are pretty good, but I've had better!All in all this was one of the best fish and shrimp dinners I've had in quite some time. I would be happy to go again!The server who serve me was outstanding!  I did not catch your name but she did a great job checking on all her tables every few minutes to make sure everybody is happy with what they had and seeing if they needed anything."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,3,"Food was ok, service was ok, nothing stood out. For an oyster house, the oysters has a bit of a weird consistency and weren't quite what I was hoping for. The fried tomatoes were fine, but again nothing special. Good spot if you want to come have a few drinks with your friends and some casual dining. Wouldn't consider it a ""must visit"" Mobile spot though."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,4,"When you're in the gulf coast it would be sacrilegious not to eat seafood. My local Yelp bud here Juliet H.and my business partners who work and live here highly recommended this place.For starters Wintzells has a large parking lot across the street to make it a bit easier for you to find a parking space.  Once inside it's loud and busy. The walls are adorned with funny and whimsical expressions and phrases. We were seated pretty quickly and as I looked at the menu I knew I had to try the seafood gumbo. The gumbo was rich and savory and you can taste the seafood in every spoonful. The added rice in the gumbo was perfect.My buddy and I ordered the broiler sampler as it had a little bit of everything, white fish, shrimp, scallops, charred oysters and your choice of two sides.The white fish was moist, flakey and delicious. The shrimp and charred oysters were seasoned perfectly and the charring on the cheese and butter on the oysters made for a tasty morsel. The scallops though were overcooked and rubbery but overall the sampler was a winner. I really enjoyed the fried okra and steamed veggiesI wish I was in the area longer as I would have made it a habit of coming here every day."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,5,"Love eating here. The service is always top notch and the food is amazing! Tonight I am having the fried green tomatoes, a bowl of gumbo, and the oven grilled platter with fried okra and collard greens. Can't go wrong with any of these!Back in Mobile again for another round. Could not decide on the type of oysters I wanted so I had the sampler and was not disappointed. My server, Heather, was outstanding and really added to my dining experience. Highly recommend requesting to be seated in her section. 5/5/19: First day back in Mobile after a long spell away. Of course my first stop after checking in is Wintzell's. The raw oysters, gumbo, and fried green tomatoes never disappoint. Finished with bread pudding. I asked for a la mode and was presented with the option of having it ""loaded"". This was amazing!!! Their famous bread pudding with candied pecans, chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and vanilla ice cream. Soooo decadent, and oh so good. I will be back again, at least once more, before I leave next weekend"
Wintzell’s Oyster House,5,"Came for the oysters and sat at the oyster bar. Al was our oyster shucker and he was AMAZING! Told us stories of his childhood growing up in Mobile (because we asked) and explained the process of choosing the best oysters. Hands down the best oysters I've ever had. Been to Wintzell's before and had oysters, but never sat at the oyster bar. These were the best because there was a story behind them. What a great asset to the restaurant. 10/10 great experience with Al."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,3,"Wintzell's is an interesting place. The menu screams seafood and southern comfort sides.I visited during happy hour and had a dozen oysters on the half shell for about $10.  The oysters were ok, but would have been better if they hadn't had so much debris and grit. These were not clean oysters and I had to constantly separate the junk from them..I had the seafood cob salad and it was awesome! It had tons of shrimp, and fish that was perfectly cooked. It also included tomatoes, eggs, bacon, and lots of other great items!My server was a 5 out of 5!!! I think her name was Kira. She was super helpful with the menu and the happy hour specials, and kept a check on me with perfectly timed visits!!I will visit Wintzell's again just to dine in her area because I know she will make my visit a great experience."
Wintzell’s Oyster House,5,"I was born and raised in Mobile, Alabama, and would come here so much. This is my favorite seafood spot in Mobile and probably ever. It's nothing fancy, just a simple, old school spot. Loads of decor on the walls of little saying plaques. The crab claws are great, I couldnt eat enough when I was a kid, but my  favorite above all are the fried oysters here, hey are sooo good. breaded and fried perfectly, great flavor, and they use fresh oysters.Oyster's rockefeller are delicious too, I highly recommend this here.The raw oysters are also great, and the pricing here is not bad at all. I miss it because now I live in Miami and they oysters do not compare to Wintzell's. I miss it so much!For dessert I love the Bread Pudding, its overall delicious, good flavor, a really ideal Bread Pudding.This place hits home for me, since I was raised coming here alot, and his place is the reason I love seafood and oysters so much. If your looking for a local favorite and great seafood, this is your place. I'm debating coming for a mini food vacation so I can eat here again LOL"
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"I would give this place 100 stars if I could - we came here on vacation after reading some reviews, and we were not disappointed. I had the smoked pulled chicken on top of a huge baked potato with the white bbq sauce, cheddar cheese, and sour cream. It was aaaaaamazing. Such good flavor and a great portion size. That white sauce truly is something special and the chicken was remarkable - so juicy and flavorful. My husband has the beef brisket - and let me tell you - it is worth whatever premium meat up charge. That bite of just the brisket alone was the best bite of bbq I've ever had. He made his a sandwich on sourdough with slaw and pickles with the sweet & spicy sauce. He said it was the perfect combination and there is nothing he would change. And that they did not skimp on the brisket serving size. For our sides we got Mac & cheese, boss beans, and banana pudding. The Mac and cheese was great - made with shells and was everything I hope for in a side dish. The beans had great flavor and a little peppery heat punch. But the banana pudding might have just stolen the show. It was sooooo good. If you are a fan of banana pudding, this is everything you hope for it to be. Highly recommended! Friendly call in service and car delivery - the staff were obviously slammed but still managed to be kind and efficient. 100/5 stars."
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,Called during Coronavirus pandemic.  They took my order and delivered it to my vehicle.  Food was just as awesome as it always is.  You guys rock from your friends at Theodore Veterinary Hospital.
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"Slap YO Moma good.....and I know grown men afraid of slappin my mama. It's that good! Best BBQ in Alabama for sure. This place has the flavor, the sauces, the smoke, and Conecuah sausage off the smoker. If you haven't been here for BBQ then what planet are you on??? This place is the Boss for a reason....."
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,4,"Great place to swing by for a quick BBQ lunch sandwich. They're smoked meats are on point! I give a 4 instead of a 5 simply because I've always found the location and the inside itself neither convenient nor remarkable. I tried dining in a couple of times but the layout makes it difficult to enjoy or have a conversation, like a business lunch conversation.But...the MEATS are GREAT!"
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"While in Mobile, our friends took us to Meat Boss.  They suggested I order the chicken on the sweet bun with the  white BBQ sauce.  It was excellent! I also ordered the Mac & cheese and really enjoyed it."
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"Stopped by to try their entry in the Hamburger cook off October 2019. While I have eaten here many times and given them 4 and 5 star ratings on all of their BBQ I have tried, I have never tried their hamburger.I got their competition burger and baked beans. The burger has 1/2 pound of ground brisket and tiny bits of bbq on top. It was the best burger I have ever eaten, you must come and try it. The beans continue to be the best bbq beans ever and are well seasoned.I do not see how other restaurants can beat this . I have 3 more to try before I cast my vote but doubt if others can be better."
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"Food 5/5Service 5/5Loved every bite. Stopped in at noon on a Saturday, stood in line for 5-10 minutes. Ordered:+Pulled chicken naked, with WHITE BBQ sauce, cheese, onions - so smoky and tender!! Loved tailoring the meat to just what I wanted. On the side the MAC AND CHEESE is out of the world! GET IT. Beans were just OK.+My husband got the pulled brisket and loved it! He seriously enjoyed the sausage as a side as well. Since it was our first time visiting, our waitress gave us all sorts of sauces to try, we loved the sweet & spicy bbq.Can't believe how fast the food came out!Easy parking."
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,4,"This is my go to place for BBQ ribs, chicken, burgers, brisket and rib candy. I'm hooked on the brisket, sweet bun, sweet and spicy sauce with jalapeno jelly and Asian slaw. Oh yeah! It's about to go down in my belly. I'm doing my happy dance, waiting for that brown bag of goodness to arrive. And since I can, I just ordered some rib candy. Yep, I did it. It's crazy delicious. Try it, eat it. Seriously.I usually get water to wash it all down. I don't want anything messing with the explosion of flavor that's going to  happen in my mouth.Enough of this, I gotta eat. Head to the boss for some Meat. for sandwiches."
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"I live in California and was on travel in the area. We stumbled upon this place and I must say I can't wait to come back! The lady who waited on us was awesome and helped with recommendations since we'd never been there before. Honestly I don't think you could order and get something that tasted horrible. The meat was so tender, juicy, had a great smoky flavor everything bbq should have. The sauces are so good too. I purchased some to bring back home and everyone loved them. This is probably the best I've had in a long time. I'm already planning our next stop when we are in the area again."
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"The pulled pork butt was plentiful and tasty, we will be back.  Dont forget the mac and cheese as well as the meat candy.Get In My Belly!!"
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"For the last few months, I have seen a BBQ joint in Mobile called ""Meat Boss."" That has been receiving high praise from several ""Best BBQ"" lists.  The hype is real!First of all, the outside looks like a quaint home but dont be fooled.  Meat Boss is more serious about BBQ than anyone in your family with a grill.  When you enter, you order at the counter.  Ordering here was a different experience than any other BBQ joint I have been to.  I usually look for like a 2 meat plate. But at Meat Boss, it is almost like going to a ""Build Your Own Burger"" joint.  After much discussion with the cashier, I settled on 3 ribs, rib candy, and a brisket sandwich on a sweet bun with pickles, slaw, and all the sauces on the side.  They call out your name when your order is ready and bring it out in brown paper sacks.  I had 2 sacks hahaFirst of all, I sampled the sauces.  There are 5 - sweet, sweet and spicy, white Bama, Carolina, and spicy Carolina. The spicy Carolina and white Bama were my favorites.  The spicy Carolina was spicy but not hot.  There was also a form to it than just the runny, peppery, vinegar Carolina style.  White Bama was the popular Bama white sauce that is mayo-based and usually made with black pepper, lemon juice, and other variety of ingredients. I thought the sweet sauce was way too sweet and I love sweet sauce.  The Carolina is exactly like the Spicy Carolina except with less bite.  The Sweet and Spicy was better than the Sweet.I tore into my ribs next.  These ribs had plenty of meat with an excellent black pepper rub on them.  These ribs I would consider eating without sauce and I'm a sauce-aholic!The rib candy was next on the agenda.  It costs $2 and the cashier described it as ""the ends of ribs cut off and carmelized with brown sugar."" I received more than I thought I would as I was thinking one big piece. Instead, I had several pieces chopped inside a cup.  It definitely had a sweet taste to it and it was too much with sweet sauce.  But with the white and Carolina, it was phenomenal with the sweet and spicy aspect.Finally, I made it to my brisket sandwich. Alabama is not known for brisket but this was among the best brisket I've had.  It was tender with a smoky flavor, and had a good bark to it.  It was on par with the ribs. I had potato salad as my side.  It was made from red potatoes in some kind of sour cream - hint of ranch concoction. It was the perfect accompaniment to my BBQ.Sweet tea was refreshingly sweet!Believe the hype! Meat Boss is a destination for any BBQ fan."
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,Two Words: Rib Candy.Didn't know Meat Boss could get any better. But then I tried the Rib Candy. It is phenomenal. I also highly recommend the Sweet and Spicy sauce. It is like no other sauce I've ever had before and TBH I have a bottle of it that I've been a tiny bit stingy with for a while. Their takeout is super quick and the quality is always on point. And: they seem to have expanded their dining area a bit. And their parking lot! Definite plus!
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"THE BEST BBQ IN TOWN!! Hands down a must stop on your bucket list. Everything from breakfast to lunch and to catering for parties. True meaning of home cooked, slow smoked, goodness."
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,Order ahead and you won't be disappointed.  The pulled pork is delicious and the portions are generous.   Boss beans are so good.  Mildly spicy.    When we get this at work everybody wants to order.   Very popular choice.
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,4,"Meat Boss is pretty darn good! The sweet bun and white sauce are stars of the show for me, hands down! The meat is good, but when I called myself going carb-less on my first visit and doing the brisket sans the bun, I almost lost it when I tasted the hubs sandwich. The difference was severe. So severe, that I'll never do that again.For me, and I'm not a necessarily a true bbq girl, the meat and sauce should be able to hold its own (right?). The sweet bun and white sauce are non-negotiables with any meal I eat at MB from here on out. Meat Boss, yes it's good and the meat is tender, but if you didn't have the sweet bun and white sauce, you did it wrong-- all wrong. Do you trust me?"
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,4,"They catered at an event that I was at & their mac & cheese shot to the top of my list. I love the oversized shells. After I went to this event, I stopped by their shop numerous times just to get mac & cheese. I also like the options of different sauces for the BBQ at the event. When I have gone into the physical location, it has always been fast service & clean. The staff is also friendly. The only con I have is that I wish they were open later. This is the reason for my 4 star review & not 5. They close at 6:30 pm most days but they also open up at 6:30 am. They serve breakfast. I have not had their breakfast but I am interested in trying it..... I'm just not sure about breakfast from a BBQ joint. 6:30 pm is just such an early closing time."
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"If you're not paying attention, you'll pass this Mobile gem and boy will you ever make the worst mistake of your life. When you walk in, it has a nice homey feel to it. You order at the counter and they bring out your order in a paper bag. I went ahead and ordered a pulled pork sandwich with sweet bun and coleslaw, conecuh sausage, potato salad, and rib tips. First thing I noticed when the food came out was the massive size of the pulled pork sandwich. Completely filled with pulled pork I was already excited to dig in. When I bit in, it proved to be just as good as it looked. The pork was soft and flavorful, the coleslaw gave a nice sweet contrast to the vinegary barbecue sauce, and the bun was deliciously fresh! I was already satisfied. The sides were just as amazing and I'll say the rib tips are a definite must get alongside the sandwich. Jeez they really give you a great meal for a super fair price! I loved everything about Meat Boss and this is definitely the only place you should be going to get barbecue in Mobile!"
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"We were really excited to try this restaurant out. We attend CHBC (downtown church) and enjoyed the Grub RuB they have the Dad's on Father's Day. Meat Boss did not disappoint. The white BBQ sauce is to DIE for! We are buying a bottle before we leave to use on our own smoked meats. If you like BBQ, I would definitely recommend checking this spot out if you are in the area."
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,"Thought the logo was cool, 4.5 star rating already, thought I'd see what's up while I was here on travel. Got the pulled chicken sandwich with white bbq sauce; that's some good meat! Good sauce too! Banana pudding's got real banana slices (I'm easily impressed if you couldn't tell) mac n cheese was thick! Alls was good!"
Meat Boss - Cottage Hill,5,Good food & large portions.    I had the stuffed potato and it was big enough for two meals
The Seafood House,5,This is my first time time but it won't be my last. The food was fresh and delicious the staff was friendly and offered help with what's good on the menu. Mobile y'all sitting on a seafood GOLD mine.  This Chicago Kid will be back again.
The Seafood House,4,Fried okra-checkCorn -checkCrab claws- check!Fried fish a bit too much cornmeal; yet still good.
The Seafood House,4,"Don't be fooled by the name. I knew it was also a fresh market, but I was thinking it might be more of a divided market and restaurant. I'll admit: I buzzed through a few food pics but didn't seem to pick up on the actual building. That said, I don't regret going the The Seafood House. It's a relatively small building with colorful paintings on the front windows. I knew before we walked in I had misjudged. It is more seafood market than restaurant. They obviously do a good business as it was busy even for an early dinner.  You're greeted at the door by a ticket machine if there's a line for the fresh food. To the left there's an order counter for food. There are several tables that have seen better days across the front, and you can sit and watch TV while you wait for your food or eat. I get the impression most food is take out instead of dine in. The food itself is pretty good. You get a generous amount in the po boy. You get a half sandwich and side for $6.99 which is a nice price. The fried shrimp plate is also generous and came with two sides. My table mate got the corn but thought it tasted a bit mushy. It was presumably cooked in the boil so it did look maybe a bit oversaturated. However, it was an overall good meal for the only before hitting the road."
The Seafood House,4,"Ok, so the food is still amazing here! Their steamed shrimp platter is generous and spicy means spicy. But...I don't think I'll be eating in any more. They charge $2.00 for a cup for ice water!! WHAT? WHY? What if you don't want sweet tea or soda? Or a bottled water? Water from the faucet should be free, I'm just saying..."
The Seafood House,4,"Decided to eat at The Seafood House while working in the Mobile area during the week.  It had great reviews and the pictures looked awesome.  I had to try it, right?The restaurant shares itself with a seafood market with fresh catches of the day offered daily.  I decided to order Crab Cakes and paired it with fried Shrimp and Oysters with Corn on the Cob and Cold Slaw.I noticed that most people order their orders to go, but they do have several tables for eating in house.  Nothing fancy, just a few tables along the front windows.The Crab Cake was pretty good.  The Shrimp and Oysters were good, too.  Not crazy about the packaged tartar, but the Cake sauce was home made and pretty good.  All in all, it was pretty good."
The Seafood House,4,I was in Mobile for a meeting and had to try the local seafood fare and The Seafood House looked like just place to go. I ordered the catfish po boy and I am a po boy snob so I was hoping for the best and was rewarded. The bread was good and the catfish pieces were large and well seasoned. The pieces were so big i has to stuff them down into the bread. It comes with fries but they were forgettable. You can also buy fresh seafood while your there. The Seafood House isn't much to look at but that's how I knew it would be good. Enjoy.
The Seafood House,5,"Not atmospheric, but the staff is nice and the food is GOOD! Came in fully ready to eat a ridiculous amount of fried food.+Crab cakes filled with a lot of crab meat, nice fry, and its own 'bangbang' sauce. Top notch.+Deep fried soft shell crab - first time having this, it was great! Loved the claws especially. Lots of meat in the center too. Breading was so tasty, reminiscent of KFC to me (a compliment in my books).  +Seafood house fries - I could LIVE IN THESE. Fries were so soft inside, and perfectly crisp on the outside. Delicious juicy shrimp and an addictive cheese/sauce combo poured on top - out of this world!!+Fried crab claw dinner - this was so interesting to me, never had fried crab claws before. Very good! Liked the ease of biting the meat off. Corn was super good, okra was alright.Only wish they made their own tarter/cocktail sauce!"
The Seafood House,5,"This place is amazing. It doesn't look like much on the outside or inside but the food is great and a lot of people get food from here. Most people only get carry-out orders from here. This is not a great place to dine in at. I ordered the combo meal. I got fried fish, fried shrimp, and fried claws. My sides were onion rings and fried okra. I wish I had multiple stomachs so I could order more food. They even had lobster tails here for $9 each. Just amazing."
The Seafood House,5,"Best place to pick up super fresh seafood at reasonable prices.  I LOVE their fresh shrimp. For an extra and very small fee, they will even steam them for you! Also available is a full menu of cooked seafood that you can take out or enjoy at one of handful of tables. The staff has always been courteous and efficient. The place is simple but clean."
The Seafood House,5,The gumbo was delicious. Fried claws crispy and not over breaded.  You would have no idea it is also a fish market (by the smell).
The Seafood House,5,I found this seafood  Restaurant on Yelp.  So happy I did; had a taste for seafood and went there for takeout today.  I got the combo with catfish; shrimp and crab tails; sides were steamed corn on cob and onion rings.  So good and enough for two people.  I will be going back.  There are a few tables inside but great place for takeout.
The Seafood House,5,Shrimp po boy is the bomb. I really enjoyed it. Fast friendly service. Clean and everything inside. Parking and prices are fair. Will return if I ever get back this way.
The Seafood House,5,"Sometimes we just like to have some good fresh seafood.  Oysters, Shrimp, Fish, and some sides.    Seafood House meets my needs with flying colors.   I even tried the egg roll they were advertising.  It was even good.  5 stars   For this spot."
The Seafood House,4,The food was fantastic!!Fried Shrimp 4.5Fried oysters 5NOT GREASYreally freshI will say it's not a date night placeBut the food was off the chain!!
The Seafood House,3,Times was off for holiday hours called but no answer so we stopped by to check everything was sold out he did well that day maybe next trip.
The Seafood House,5,"Fresh boiled crawfish!! Seasoned perfectly! Can't beat the price, what can I say more. So happy that these weren't frozen. There's such a big difference of frozen and live crawfish. I got the Cajun flavor and it was spicy and delicious. The lemon pepper flavor is different but very good. I will order that flavor next. Staff were sweet and helpful. She asked if I wanted to try it first."
The Seafood House,5,"There are a lot of seafood markets and restaurants in the area but this is always my go-to. Best prices for what you get and a stacked menu. I personally am not a fan of fried seafood so I always go for the things off the steamer menu, but everything they make is done well. Busiest times are near close and pretty much all of Sunday, but the quality is always worth the occasional waiting."
The Seafood House,5,"The food here is always delicious. The wait can be a little long because they make everything to order, but its definitely worth the wait. And if you don't want to wait, just call in your order ahead of time.They also have a fresh seafood section and a freezer section where you can buy food to prepare at home as well.The staff is cool and the food is great, so I highly recoommend this spot if you're in the area."
The Seafood House,4,Visited this spot two times in three years while passing through Mobile Alabama. The staff is friendly and work hard to get your order done quickly.  I  went there for the blue crabs and crawfish.  The crawfish is good enough for seasoned crawfish eaters and the boiled crabs hit the spot. They also sell fresh seafood for you to take home and cook your way. I like this spot.
The Seafood House,5,I see why their rating is good.  We had the medium boiled shrimp & the appetizer crab cakes.  There about 8 tables that you can sit and eat at but most folks are getting take out.  Also you can get raw seafood to take home and cook at reasonable prices.  Would definitely come back.
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,"What a fun place.  I wanted to order something rather basic.  Being new to the south, I want to try 'southern' dishes.  I asked if I could have a taste of the pimento cheese.  Very tasty with a bit of a bite, not a bad bite, nice and it lets you know its there.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, and added the rest of the huge scoop of pimento cheese to it.  OMG, how good.When I order a burger with bacon, it is not unusual to have the bacon hange out of the bun.  What is unusual is to have the burger hang over the bun.  It was a full meal in itself.  I honestly felt bad about only tasting the two sides that came with the burger.  Fries were crispy and fresh, the side of fried okra was much better than I had expected. (Hubby thought they were great and ate his and my orders).Well worth the time, I will return to this restaurant on my next trip to Mobile."
Mama’s On Dauphin,4,So we came to explore Mobile while staying in Pensacola and last time we were here from the advice of the candy store tried Noble South which was awesome. The day we came they were closed so we decided to go back to the candy store and ask for another suggestion. They told us Mamas.This place was pretty awesome. The waitress was super nice and the owner was right on top of things.I started with the gumbo which was not the best I had but it was good. Next time I'd get the cup of it because it was a lot. I had some fried chicken which was awesome and also the fried okra which was amazing. The turnip greens were also really good. You do get a ton of food here so don't worry about leaving hungry.
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,"Quick service and the food was delicious! They weren't too busy when we went there and the food came out in less than ten minutes. We had the chicken and dumplings and shrimp creole, which were the Friday specials. Both were really good and the cornbread was tasty too."
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,"So, my shoebox app reminded me that I went here a year ago today... why have I not been back, you may ask? I asked myself the same question! I asked my hubby the same question! I really need to go back! It was so awesome, I loved it! So much so that I took and saved pictures of my food from a year ago! Veggie plate never disappoints, great service, and of course, you gotta try the Banana puddin'!"
Mama’s On Dauphin,1,"Very poor customer service. I ordered a cup of gumbo and it was nothing but rice. I was already late going back to work when the server returned I politely asked for a different serving because there was nothing in the cup. She disappeared saying she would check on it. She never returned. When the second server finally returned with my bill, I said I dont want this because there is nothing but rice and it is a very small cup not worth $5.00. Wow now after 4 days MAMA put the bill thru my bank. I called again to say I didnt want the gumbo and they should not have charged me. The owner Marshall argues with me....well that's how his gumbo is....no apology for service or for charging for food I never ate. Also defending his $5 cup of rice. PLEASE DO NOT GO TO MAMAS......too many other choices downtown. Their staff is rude."
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,What a great little spot. Everyone in here is so so friendly and the service and food is lightening fast. I ordered the grilled pimento cheese sandwich with fried okra and squash casserole and everything was excellent. The okra was well seasoned and crunchy. The squash casserole was full of flavor and nice and creamy. The grilled pimento cheese has just enough spice and the bread was nicely grilled. The prices are pretty good (everything above was $11) and can't wait to come back. Everyone around me seemed to be enjoying the banana pudding (I can't stand banana pudding so I wouldn't be able to give it a fair shot). Definitely a great spot for lunch in downtown Mobile and will certainly be back.
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,Great home cookin and you get your food in 7 min or less. I'm always amazed how they can offer such good soul food and such great service. It's always packed out for lunch and yet you can actually get in and get out in less than 30 min. I usually get the pork chops and sides. Wife got the pimento cheese sandwhich with greens and Mac and cheese. She said it was like a warm hug from grandma. It made her do the happy dance. . If you are a pimento cheese fan it's a must!
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,"If you like southern fare, Mama's will not disappoint.  The hardest decision you will make is what to eat. I have been making my way through the daily specials and have yet to be disappointed. Great atmosphere and wonderful staff.  Mama's is a foot place for ""home cooking""."
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,"Man o man... good stuff!!!! The service was top notch, like best service ever. Attentive, friendly, speedy, just great. The food was delicious! This is a must try while in Mobile."
Mama’s On Dauphin,1,"***Catering Review ONLY***I truly hate that I have to report this assault of my plate and palate. Although I was initially super excited, I'm saddened to report that my first Mama's on Dauphin experience was horrible. My Mama's restaurant visit has been highly anticipated since moving to Mobile, but when a catered event at GulfQuest beat me to the punch, I was more than happy to roll with it. This event and the beautiful venue had all the makings of a great time. Hopefully, the dine-in experience is on the COMPLETE opposite end of the spectrum because I pouted over my barely-touched plate all night long. First, let's start with the positives. The catering staff was quite friendly and cleared plates promptly. Secondly, the shrimp cocktail was a blessing, otherwise I'd have starved, and the sweet tea was perfectly sweetened--  that's all I've got. Meh: The fried shrimp were ok, but nothing to rave about or compel you to revisit. Cons: The grits were bland, and the accompanying ""red sauce"" was tart, tomato-y, and more closely resembled a canned spaghetti sauce. (I'm literally scowling as I type right now, y'all. It was so bad) I haven't had a shrimp and grits that tasted this way, ever, and especially not on the gulf coast. 'Twas absolutely appalling. Next up, the fried fish filets that had no shape and appeared to have been purchased from your grocer's freezer. The batter was doughy, tasteless, hard, and over cooked. (I wish I'd taken photos, but my plate looked terrible)Finally, there was a seafood-ish bowtie pasta salad of sorts that was served neither warm nor cold, and lacked any noticeable flavor. Y'all, I was floored. Mama's catering has got to do better than this. I'm still interested in visiting the restaurant and (hopefully) noting the strong juxtaposition. But, as for my catered introduction to Mama's-- Le sigh. (face palm)"
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,"Yummy! It's just like going to your southern mamas house for Sunday dinner! I usually get one if the daily specials and have never been disappointed. Today, I had the pimento cheese grilled cheese. It was like a taste of home. My husband, who doesn't like pimento cheese, even had to admit it was good.  If you're looking for good southern comfort food, don't miss Mama's on Dauphin."
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,While visiting and socializing in downtown Mobile I have had the opportunity to have lunch here twice.  All previous reviews have given all their pluses.  The two that stood out to me were service and quality.While they are very busy waiting is handled in a timely manner and the aroma of the food along with the chatter of the patrons make for a short wait.  A server quickly come to your table for drink orders and if your ordering the daily special you can go ahead and put in your order.I would recommend the daily specials but some in our party ordered from the regular menu with out any issues.  The food was exceptional with my favorite being meatloaf with mashed potatoes and tomato gravy on the side.  I love dipping.While the banana pudding comes highly recommended it didn't register highly with me but....wifey exclaimed it was great!!!  Happy wife... happy life!
Mama’s On Dauphin,4,"Great food! I ordered the fried chicken plate with mashed potatoes/gravy, collard greens, and macaroni & cheese. The side portions were kind of small (only reason I give them 4 stars). However, everything tasted great! I definitely recommend it if you're wanting some good southern style foods!"
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,"Mama's is a local favorite meat and three located on Dauphin Street!  Open for lunch Monday through Friday its a smaller, unassuming cafe with about 20 tables and a lunch counter!  Few things to know, it gets busy and they cook everything fresh so that means that if the daily specials are what you are looking for, they have been known to run out!  Secondly, its first come first served and there can be a line sometimes. Thirdly its street parking, and with Dauphin street being the place a great number of restaurants are, parking can be a drag. However, keeping those things in mind, if your in the mood for a great southern meal give Mama's a shot!Having been here on several occasions, I can tell you I have never had a bad meal here.  The country fried steak, fried pork chops, fried chicken, the club wrap, and the salads are all amazing!  The sides are all freshly prepared but I highly recommend the mashed potatoes and or macaroni and cheese!  The ranch dressing for the salads is homemade and creamy and really is not something you want to pass up!  The waitstaff is always friendly but on their game, get ready to have awesome service and an awesome meal!Mama's is an amazing meal served with true southern hospitality! Looking for a meat and three for lunch, don't pass up Mama's, locals and visitors alike have been enjoying meals here for years.  Once you give it a shot, you will know why!"
Mama’s On Dauphin,4,"Visiting my home town and came downtown to meet my friend for lunch. He suggested Mama's for some good southern cooking, who am I to argue?I got the chicken fried steak lunch special. It came with mashed potatoes and cornbread and 2 sides (french fries and mac and cheese). This place brings the goods! Luckily it was Christmas week so there was nobody in the downtown area. I was informed usually there are lines out the door of people waiting, and I can see why.Downtown? Like country cooking? Look no further!"
Mama’s On Dauphin,4,"I just had a late lunch at Mama's for my first time, but it will NOT be my last. I was in the mood for a country-style veggie plate, and, boy, did I go to the right place!  I ordered Mac and cheese, which was not the best I ever had, but it was good; green beans, that tasted like my granny used to make -- yummy; black-eyed peas, yum; and squash casserole that was DELISH!!!  They were out of several things, which was understandable since I went in after the lunch rush. Their sweet tea is perfectly sweetened and strong just like I like it. They were out of cornbread, but I'll be back to try that soon!  I sat at the bar and the service was great!   Try it. You'll like it!!!"
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,"YUM!!!Came here for lunch with a co-worker while we were in town.  So glad she picked it!I had the ""famous"" chicken salad salad. I feel like a lot of places claim their chicken salad is famous, but this one really should be!  I asked our server's suggestion for dressing and she recommended the ranch. I didn't even need it. The chicken salad itself was so flavorful I didn't want to taint it with the ranch.  The tossed salad portion was crisp, chilled and fresh. I really enjoyed it.Service was amazing! My tea never got below half full and our server was the perfect amount of friendly, attentive and efficient. Highly recommend this for a quick lunch, or a long one!"
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,We had our after rehearsal dinner at Mama's and it was fantastic! The service was exceptional and the food was amazing! I would highly recommend this restaurant for any event or just for lunch. They are incredibly easy to work with.
Mama’s On Dauphin,4,Great food. This was an impromptu stop for us. Unfortunately we didn't know a conference was going on in the area so it was extra busy. They did what they could with the staff. Wait times were long and the inside was hotter than the outside since the door was opening so much.  I was disappointed that they ran out of squash casserole and didn't let me know until I got my food. Hopefully next time they will prep better when a conference is in town to accommodate all. Maybe add more staff and make more food.
Mama’s On Dauphin,5,Great place for lunch. The lunch specials are reasonably priced under $10.Big portions and home cooked.Don't forget banana pudding. If could have gotten it through TSA i would have had took one for the road.Quick serve.
Dauphin’s,5,"The food was great and they were very polite, didn't have anything that was bad and the service was great.  My only problem was finding it, thought it was in the RSA tower but it's in the trustmark bank building"
Dauphin’s,2,"I was pretty disappointed with my first experience here. We came for Sunday Brunch. I was really looking forward to something delicious. I had a nice time because I was there with friends. The biscuits with whipped hibiscus butter were yummy and the sax player played beautifully.We started with the ""Beignets á la Dauphin's"" with mango sauce. There were five 1""x 1 1/2"" beignets. We had trouble locating the mango sauce but they were good enough and we happily ate them. My entrée was a bit sad. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken itself was pretty good. It had great flavor and was nice and hot. However, the eggs and waffles were not edible. The waffles were cold in the center and hard (I was really expecting some delicious Belgian Waffles.) I kind of hope they were not made that day because they tasted like they must be old, stale or dare I say.... still slightly frozen. They were bad. I always eat my food but I was not able to eat them. If those were made that day they have greater issues to deal with. I took one bite of my eggs (they were cold) and tried a little of the waffle. In the end I just ate the chicken and was super grateful for the biscuits.My husband ordered a bowl of ""Gumbo Z'herb"" which he said was nothing like gumbo and just tasted like a bowl of greens with a few pieces of sausage in it.I definitely was not blown away in the slightest And question whether I would come back to try dinner. I'm leaning heavily toward NO right now.All that being said, I had a great time with my friends."
Dauphin’s,3,"Headed to this place on my first night and Mobile and wasn't particularly impressed. When I arrived, I was happy to learn they were on the 34th floor with amazing views! I sat at the bar which didn't face the views but was still close enough that I could see everything. Happy hour here is awesome with almost everything on their menu half priced (drink wise). I ordered a vodka Thyme drink which was tasty but a bit sweeter than I would have liked. Josh and Hannah were excellent bartenders and gave me advice on what to order. I had a Caesar salad to start  and crab claws for my dinner. They brought the salad  out with a chilled fork which made me feel fancy. Unfortunately, my main dish wasn't as exciting. The quantity was large, but as I began to dig into my crab claws I started realizing this ammonia smell in my dish. This smell indicates that the seafood has gone bad and has been stored improperly or for too long. The sauce also drowned out the flavor of the blue crab which I didn't prefer. They should give a butter and garlic only option. I complained and they took the crab off my bill. This was generous and appreciated; but a place as grand as this should never serve rotten seafood."
Dauphin’s,5,"The view! Wow, absolutely breathtaking view of the city. We went downtown for Sunday brunch at Dauphin's. I had the Eggs Al la bama which consisted of fried green tomatoes, eggs, conecuh sausage, and potatoes. It was all covered in cheese and served with grits. Definitely not the healthy choice (although there were healthy options) but it was as delicious as it looks! There was a saxophonist playing which added to the ambience. The entire experience was beautiful."
Dauphin’s,5,"This was a nice treat at the end of a long conference day. I went with my boss and two other colleagues and we all had a nice meal and drinks. I was very excited about the Pimm's cocktail, which was refreshing, per usual. For dinner, I had the Airline Chicken. It was juicy and very flavorful. The mash and green beans were equally well-flavored. Bread and butter cake first, and one of the butters had sweet hibiscus in it, so it's pink. The meal also ends with a smoking pot of melt in your mouth chocolate truffles, which was unique, and a conversation piece for the table. Although I think it's early for such things, the restaurant is fully decorated for Xmas, and it is very pretty. It doesn't outshine the spectacular view you have from being 33 floors up though! (The restaurant is on the 34th floor, but the building, as it traditional, does not ""have"" a 13th floor)."
Dauphin’s,5,"Came here for an anniversary dinner for the in-laws. We loved it! My fish was perfectly cooked, our waiter, Stevie P. was very attentive and took great care of us. My hubby was well pleased with his stuffed Flounder although it was fishy compared to my Sheepshead. (I tend to like really white flaky fish) We were thankful they had a kids menu. ;-) and the kids were served first. We made a reservation a week in advance and at the last minute found we needed to add one more to our party. They were very accommodating and seemed more worried about our being uncomfortable than about having to switch things up despite being booked solid. We really enjoyed ourselves and will be back!"
Dauphin’s,4,"This restaurant has such a beautiful view if the city, it really sets the mood for your experience. The hostess were personable and gave us the option to be seated right away or wait for the rest of our party to arrive. The food was delicious but took a while to come out. The complimentary biscuits were a nice touch and I love the hibiscus butter. The live musician played a variety of songs both old and new. All the beignets were overcooked, instead of being a nice golden brown they were very dark chocolate brown and not fluffy."
Dauphin’s,5,A beautiful restaurant on the top of the RSA Tower in downtown Mobile. The restaurant has a beautiful view of Mobile from nearly every seat. The menu is excellent and has daily lunch specials with reasonable pricing. I had the fish of the day which was fresh flounder. It was covered in a sauce with sides of squash and coconut rice. The staff are very attentive. There is a piano for happy hour. What's not to love about this great place? I will be back very soon for dinner.
Dauphin’s,4,Stopped by for lunch with Mom. Great lunch choices. I actually enjoyed the lunch Bette Ethan brunch and dinner.  Definitely a lunch option that's not too pricey in Downtown Mobile.
Dauphin’s,5,"Five stars for certain.  On the latest episode of Fine Dining in Mobile Alabama....we decided to try something new.  The Mobile Stew was as good as the description suggested on the menu.  Flavorful and chunked full of my seafood favorites.  Shrimp, Oysters, sausage and crab.   So good. Also found out happy hour drinks are half price.  Yum yum.  The Manhattans were 3 of the best I've ever had.  1/2 price made them taste even better.  Top notch experience went to our vantage point. We were able to watch the parade from our table.  What a wonderful night with my lovely bride. Kudos to Savannah and the rest of the wait staff."
Dauphin’s,2,"We came here for brunch with some friends on a Sunday brunch at 11:00. First off they would not let us make a reservation and said they were booked but we could come and eat in the front lounge area. We got there at 11:00 and no one was there whatsoever. Hannah was our waitress. She was not great. We all ordered. I ordered the chicken and waffles. It comes with 2 eggs. The menu does say they come sunny side up. She didn't say anything and didn't ask if that was ok or if i wanted them another way .....as they would do in almost every other restaurant ever......but i forgot to order otherwise since I don't like them runny.  When they came out I asked if that was normal. She said,"" you didn't say anything."" Obviously she could tell that I wasn't pleased but didn't offer to correct or do anything. A good waitress would have said, ""I'll put you in 2 more eggs how would you like them done? ""Ya know? The chicken had great flavor but the waffles were cold and hard. Literally egos would have been better. So of my 14.00 entree, I ate 2 small pieces of chicken thigh. Now a great waitress .....IMO would see a 250 lb man and notice that he didn't eat the waffles and the eggs remained on the plate and only ate the 2 small pieces of chicken and know something is wrong. She didn't ask nor seemed to care. I'm not the guy to send things back but I probably should have. My wife said hers was great. I was not impressed. It is a great view and the saxophone player was great but I'll be spending my 60.00 elsewhere next brunch.  We have Eaten here for dinner many times and have bought gift cards and such for business and had anniversary dinners here.....but this trip ......Very disappointed."
Dauphin’s,5,"Located on the 34th floor of an office building, the restaurant offers amazing views. I sat at the bar since I was alone. My bartender Bri was outstanding. There were several menu choices since I was at 4pm. The happy hour menu from 3-6pm an the early bird menu I think from 4-6pm, not 100%. I chose several apps, the West Indies crab,great quality and plenty to share, but not the way that I like my blue crab. Then I had the poke. Very tasty and another large portion. More rice than needed, but there was definitely not lacking in the tuna department. This dish came dressed with some kind of amazing pecans. They were incredible. The amazing part was the tiny pice of pickled ginger under each pile. What a great flavor combination. Last and the best was on Bri's suggestion that I get the gator appetizer blackened. I said surprise me and she Broughton a plate half fried and half blackened. Both were amazing with the grilled winning out. Great service with great food. I will be back"
Dauphin’s,5,"On vacation and in the mood for a good steak, Dauphin's came highly recommended so we stopped in for dinner. We made reservations and arrived a little early so we had a pre-meal cocktail to start off with. Our bartender was friendly and greeted us warmly. I ordered an old fashion but was a little dismayed that a large orange slice was muddled into the drink. Not the classic version I'm accustomed too but not a total loss either so I powered through lol. Our hostess let us know our table was ready and walked us to our table. Located on the 34th floor and being seated by the window we had a great view of the city and the illuminated buildings in the downtown area. Our server came by and introduced himself and ran through the specials for the day and also made some wine recommendations. I decided to start with the poke' appetizer and it was absolutely delicious. Our server told us afterwards that the chef has just finished a stint in Hawaii and had recently added it to the menu, lucky for me.Next, I had the Gorgonzola, pear & baby spinach salad. Great contrast of the sweet pears and candies pecans against the Gorgonzola cheese, very tasty.For the main course I ordered the peppercorn crusted filet mignon. It came out a perfect medium rare. It was juicy and seasoned well. Finally, for dessert we treated ourselves to the white chocolate & sun dried cherry bread pudding a la mode. It was simply delicious. Warm and sweet that went perfectly with the ice cream. I will definitely return here the next time I'm in town and will bring my family."
Dauphin’s,5,"Exceptional service from placing reservation, greeting and throughout service. I was especially pleased with the wait staff of Shea and young male waiter, forgot name but he's pursing his online Bus Admin degree. Dauphin's was very accommodating to my lactose intolerance allergy and even gave me a special dark chocolate bon bon. Shrimp cocktail was yummy and fresh. Gumbo is non-dairy and not heavy like others. Spiky lobster was great too. The view is amazing and people often get up to take photos. Will be back next time in Mobile. PS management - Great wait staff!"
Dauphin’s,5,"On the 34th floor, you find this amazing restaurant/bar. We visited twice during our stay in Mobile. The first time as was on Saturday night, just to see if the views were amazing as told. YES! The view of the city is amazing.  We sat at the bar,  had some drinks, and the bread pudding for dessert. I had the thyme out drink, very good. Then a drink that the bartender made up, because I said surprise me! Everything we drank and ate was so good. There was a gentleman playing the piano, beautifully. He took any song request. The next day we went around noon for Sunday brunch. We both got the shrimp and grits with mimosas. 12/10!! The food was delicious, mimosas just right, and great service. It was called a Jazz brunch, with a gentleman playing upbeat Jazz music. I highly recommend this place for dinner or for brunch. Or for Saturday night drinks and dessert!"
Dauphin’s,5,This was a five-star experience all the way. Allow me to break it down for you. Dauphin's is a penthouse restaurant and the atmosphere has a luxe appeal that's looks and feels great. The saxophonist played beautifully throughout our experience. The service staff was incredible in every way and the view was spectacular.  We had brunch and the presentations of our meals were impressive and tasted very good (four stars).We tried Chef Zucker's Smoked Gumbo Z'herb while we were on the Bienville Bites Food Tour a few days ago and it was incredible. I am looking forward to bringing my husband and the rest of the family to Dauphin's.
Dauphin’s,4,Once we finally found this place - it was magnificent!!!  We showed up for happy hour and it did not disappoint.  We had a few of the cocktails and appetizers.  The cheese plate was delish!!!
Dauphin’s,5,"I will say it again, a five star review for me is extremely rare, but Dauphine's could not be accurately represented by any less. I will say this... make a reservation! With your reservation indicate that you want to sit by the window and specify which direction you prefer.My friend brought me here for brunch one morning before heading. I was a little worried that I did not dress up more since the ambience was a little bit formal. They do not have a dress code but do not feel out of place. Maybe wear a button up or a nice top with jeans. Our waiter, Jimmothy was extraordinary! He had that ""little something extra"" that just made our experience feel like you were at a friend's dinner party.I recommend the make-your-own Bloody Mary. I ran out of room. Ask your waiter for a Cajun shrimp to top it off. The homemade biscuits are a must! Tried both the regular butter and the pink butter."
Dauphin’s,4,"Dauphin's is definitely the talk of the town and the best dining view of the town, too! I've visited for Sunday brunch on two separate occasions, and again for cocktails with a view. Trust me, the ""Thyme Out"" is totally worth the trip! But back to brunch, the Beef Grillades is delicious. I can appreciate a savory, beefy gravy with my grits. That was a brunch first for me. I have also kept it simple with the traditional egg breakfast w/ sausage and grits-- also great. In the dessert world, I must say that Dauphin's presents  one of the most gorgeous Creme brûlées I've ever seen. (See photo, she's a beauty) All in all, Dauphin's is definitely a spot to visit when you're on a mission to impress the out-of-towners (and in-towners too)!"
Dauphin’s,4,"Beautiful panoramic views of Mobile and the port. Can't beat the view! Went here for lunch and had the daily soup (Shrimp and Corn) and the Tuna Poke bowl. The soup was very nice and the bread is fresh and chewy (try the pink hibiscus butter!). The tuna was nice and fresh, as was the edamame and pickled ginger. The candied pecans were a bit of an odd addition but were tasty. The jasmine rice was too salty, and would have preferred plain jasmine rice as there was already plenty of flavor in the dish. Really want to come back for dinner and jazz brunch."
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,This place is so good!! The food taste awesome and staff so helpful.. I will be coming back and 2 thumbs up.
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,3,"I been anticipating to come check this restaurant out for the longest due to the reviews and pictures but just never had the time. Overall A-OK for food quality and service. I dropped in on a Saturday evening and was seated right away. The way the restaurant works is you go to the cashier and pay up front with the menu on the wall next to you. They serve fountain drinks as well with a self serve center and use plastic utensils such as forks, spoons , and disposable chopsticks. I went ahead and ordered the Vietnamese style po-boy, Pho, and a cold rice noodle plate with grilled pork. The restaurant itself is really clean and vibrant with all the nicely decorative pictures on the walls, and new tables and booths. Within 10 minutes of ordering all three of our entrees came out and looked amazing! I was super excited to dig in but first I need to snap my pictures. Quick time first bite! The pho looked great and I love the idea how they use rectangular bowls instead of your standard circle bowls. It really adds a nice touch to the product. I Noticed the Pho wasn't garnished with green onions and cilantro  but noticed a small plate of the fresh vegetable's beside it. The veggie platter came with a small handful of beansprouts a couple of twigs of fresh Thai basil, 2 lime halves, and 2 jalapeno slices. As always.. before garnishing the dish with the veggies I had to take a slurp of the natural broth and see what I was working with. First thought was good flavor but yet very salty. I liked how the rare beef slices were still raw and were waiting to be dunked into the broth to add more flavor to the soup and become very tender and flavorful. The broth was very rich and they even had a beef bone in the broth with a chunk of meat attached to it which was fall apart tender but yet I just couldn't get over how salty it was. The noodles were not al dente which I prefer because I like that snap back when slurping the noodles and broth. They even provided hoisin sauce and siracha which I really like how they kept it chilled in the refrigerator which I used to dip my meat and meatballs in. Next dish was the grilled pork over noodles which was garnished with shredded lettuce, carrots, and cucumbers and surprisingly enough there was no crushed peanuts with it but was complimented with a side of fish sauce which complemented it. After pouring the fish sauce over the dish and mixing and incorporating everything in together I dug in for the first bite. Immediately I noticed how flavorful the grilled pork was and how tender it was from the thin freshly slices of marinated grilled pork cooked over a open fire flame. The noodles were cooked perfect and the fresh veggies complemented everything very well but I wished there was some crushed peanuts for that added texture when eating it.Next bite was the Viet style Po-boy and wow it was looking nice! It was layered with Viet deli slices of ham and garnished with pickled daikon and carrots topped off with thin cuts of jalapeno peppers, cucumbers, and layered on a fresh bed of green cilantro. The bread was heated and toasted and had a nice crunch when biting into to. The pate and mayonnaise really added a nice creamy texture to it while everything inside the sandwich just fell into place. Within 6 bites I smashed the sandwich and left happy.Overall nice A-Ok spot for a quick bite to eat in a restaurant but not technically a restaurant due to ordering upfront at the counter, plastic utensils, and self garbage disposal as well as self drink refills but with restaurant prices. The staff was great and provided service with a smile and was eager to help within anything but then again I'm a firm believer sometimes its the little things that add up to make it a Woo Hoo as good as it gets place or Yaay! Im a fan! and then again just couldn't get over the saltiness of the pho."
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,"We came here last minute on a search for dinner in a Monday night, since a few of our favorites aren't open on Monday's (gotta love Mobile). Man did we sure get lucky!The chicken is soooooo delicious. Rarely am I ever this impressed by chicken but Jade Flames knows how to make some tasty chicken. My fiancé and I both ordered the chicken noodle,  both loved the chicken and thought the noodles were ok a little bland, but we aren't Vietnamese food experts so we weren't sure if that's how it's supposed to be. Egg rolls are great too.Menu isn't too crazy big, but that's ok because the food is big on taste. Can't wait to return and try other items!"
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,"Good and fresh ingredients. Very helpful staff. Our party of three tried the pho, pork with noodles, chicken bahn mi, and beef with fried rice. Every dish was so flavorful. The beef is worth the $1 upcharge. Their menu has been adjusted here and there since they've been open and I thinks it's pretty perfect at this point. I'm just happy that pho will be an every day menu item, as in the past they only served it on Friday and Saturday."
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,"The food truck order was great! Makes me want to visit the store front!The recently launch Jade food truck came to our work complex so I jumped at the chance to try it. They had a few hiccups with the food truck but once they got rolling it was all good.I ordered the fire grilled pork Bahn mi (see pic)  a two egg roles. FLAVOR FLAVOR FLAV! this dish was So yummy. The marinaded grilled pork I could eat pounds off. Garnished with some veggies, cilantro fresh jalepeno. YUM! The chips were good and the egg rolls were also delicious. Their duck sauce has a nice kick too.Definitely will eat again"
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,"Sweet baby Jesus, Jade Flames is GOOD! I bookmarked, I came, I enjoyed, and I can't wait to go back! The restaurant is super clean, the staff greeted us immediately, and helped us out with great recommendations for our meals. The hubs and I settled on the pork noodles, chicken and rice, egg roll appetizer, and a Thai tea to share. All were delish, but my pork noodles won the night. SO GOOD! We left stuffed and super satisfied. We were even told that Jade Flames adds Pho to their menu on Fridays and Saturdays, so that's a must! See ya' real soon!"
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,"Oh my goodness! I LOVE Jade Flames! The restaurant is immaculately clean, the customer service is amazing and the food will keep me coming back for sure.I had the Pork Bahn Mi sandwich. This is something that I always love and have tried at many restaurants. Some have been so disappointing but my sandwich here was completely satisfying. Wouldn't have changed anything. The portion was good and the flavor was dynamite. I can't wait to come back and try some more of the menu options."
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,I went in on a Saturday and got the Jade Banh Mi to go. Large sandwich that really fills you up! Includes raw jalapeños so don't get those unless you like super spicy food. Loved the sandwich and the simple menu options! Can't wait to return for a cup of Vietnamese iced coffee and an entree.
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,"Finally got to try this place...It is very clean and new! The Steak Vermicelli was delicious! Very perfectly seasoned, but I did have to cut a lot of little fatty pieces off. Maybe it's only me that is grossed out by that... I was the only person there with about a 1/4 of a cup of fat on my plate when we were done. I like that they serve the vermicelli with cabbage and mint. Haven't had it with that combo before. Will definitely be back!"
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,"I've been waiting for a good bahn mi place here in mobile for some time, and this place is SO good! So clean, the friendliest staff and awesome fresh food. I've had their bahn mi's and fried rice, and you can't go wrong with either. The food is made to order and always hot. They also offer a military discount, which is awesome. Support local and gives these guys a try!"
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,4,"Great addition to the healthy meal offerings in the Cottage Hill/Schillinger area of Mobile! Recently opened, very clean, and easily accessible. The manager and crew are very friendly and the food is fresh, not overly salted, and flavorful. The only reason I don't give this quick-bite style restaurant 5 stars is because fish sauce is the only condiment offered. If you ask you can get sweet and sour. I prefer hoisin sauce. This will be a go-to place when we are in Mobile. Welcome to the neighborhood, Jade Flames!"
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,4,"New Vietnamese place in Wemo! Inside was clean as a whistle. It was spacious and new. The wife has been wanting to try it so we gave it a go. I had the chicken and rice. The chicken had a great flavor and was grilled with some nice char. it was a very good sized portion. And had simple but good flavors. It came with some garnish and fish sauce. The wife got the ban mi sandwich. She really liked it and it looked like a nice 8 inch sandwich. The owner and also the cook came out a few times to check and ask we we needed anything. They are very attentive. The menu only has like 10 items on it. Sandwiches, plates, and noodles. The egg rolls were very good also!"
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,"The food was great . We had PHO, fried rice and egg rolls. It was clean and the staff was very nice and friendly. You can eat in or take outt and prices are really reasonable. We will be back to enjoy more menu items."
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,Great grilled pork Bahn Mi.   The menu is small but I'd rather have a few items that are done well than many items that are just ok
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,"My family and I each got a different dish in order to try everything. NO disappointments! I personally got the Jade Burger, which you wouldn't imagine would be good at a Vietnamese place. It was delicious! The cabbage was sweet with fresh jalapeños, making the burger blend nicely. The best dish of all was my mom's Pho. The broth was fatty and absolutely delicious. You could tell it took hours to stew and it also had a kick to it, which was made possible by the floating jalapeños. I could've drank a gallon! The wait staff was so kind and welcoming. 10/10 will be back for some more Pho!"
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,"Awesome place to get true pho! Egg rolls are off the chain too ( thanks to the owner's mom)!!! I got the beef pho with a twist... I asked them to sub the normal beef round for the grilled beef and it was very good!!! Also got the pork fried rice and it too was awesome! Next time I go I will get them to sub the beef round for the grilled pork that's in the fried rice!!! Also in case you are military ask for the discount!!! The owner is very good people and is also former military. All there food is fresh and home made! Definitely not made from pho powder but the real deal! For you Alabama folks that have not had Thai food before or had one of the other Pho places around, take a chance on this place u won't be disappointed!!!! The best Thai we have had in mobile to date!!!"
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,4,"Ive been twice. Had the Ban Sandwich Chicken. It was very good but a tad sweet. Im sure they can modify that if asked.Second visit had the beef Pho. It was pretty good but not great. Some of the beef was still on the bone and too tough. It needs more time cooking.The broth was tasty, but lacked the traditional spices taste and was a little oily. I only ate the noodles, broth, sliced beef and meatball. But it was good to taste a different type of Pho. Still prefer Pot Au Pho for soup. I will say the rice plates looked amazing...i will be back to try them also.Place is clean, service is really good."
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,The staff were very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu items. I ordered the Jade Bahn Mi from his suggestion. It was very good and a generous portion. I generally order vermicelli when I have Vietnamese and definitely plan to go back and try the pork vermicelli. My husband got the chicken and rice. It was also a very generous portion and really delicious! I am planning to return soon!
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,Amazing place it's a 35 mile round trip but worth it. Order one of each sandwich and a dinner to make up for the drive. If closer. Would eat here everyday. Great owners and appreciative of your business.
Jade Flames Vietnamese Grill,5,"Finally got to try this restaurant... and very happy I did. Ordered the Jade Banh Mi, egg rolls, and an iced coffee.  The banh mi was wonderful, crusty bread, crisp veggies, and meat with actual flavor.  A wonderful combination, if you are adverse to spice ask them to leave the jalapeños off.  The egg rolls were wrapped in spring roll wrappers not wonton wrappers, the filling is very flavorful and the dipping sauce pairs well, think of it like duck sauce with a little kick, just a little though.Now the iced coffee, where to start... imagining the strongest coffee you make at home reduced down to be even stronger then add evaporated milk and little to no sugar.  IT IS AWESOME!!!!! Definitely not for everyone, especially if you don't like the flavor of evaporated milk, my mom used in her hot tea so is a familiar flavor for me.Oh yeah... Pho on Saturdays !!!Great little place with a small menu done very well, give them a try."
The Royal Scam,5,This place was conveniently located a block from my hotel so myself and my colleague followed the advice of our Yelp reviews and were not disappointed.  Service was great and food was excellent. I started with a bowl of seafood gumbo and then got the shrimp étouffée.  My colleague started with the tuna martini and also got the shrimp étouffée.  She was kind enough to let me try her tonight which was very fresh and which was served in a martini glass. The gumbo was a great starter on a cold night in Mobile. The portion size was just enough. The broth tasted great and the gumbo was full of seafood. The étouffée had a tomato-based spicy sauce I had plenty of shrimp on the plate.  The étouffée was also very good but the gumbo was definitely the star of the meal.I'm a fan of the royal scam!! Thanks.
The Royal Scam,5,"Great spot for a big, delicious meal. Their menu is pretty basic: burger, steak, fish, fish tacos. However, the quality is fantastic. I ordered the catch of the day, which was HUGE! It came atop of truffled orzo and a side of carrots. Everything was very flavorful. The service is also super nice. My dining companions had the filet, and had great things to say. We left with 3 clean plates, so we were very satisfied. The drinks are also solid, and their pours are anything but slight. Their liquor selection is decent and they feature $6 specialty cocktails on the chalkboard. Will definitely be back!"
The Royal Scam,5,"Great experience. Service was friendly and prompt. Food was excellent. I had the land and sea combo and opted for the upgrade to scallops instead of crab cakes. I've had their crab cake appetizer years ago and remember it being delicious, but I can rarely pass up scallops. The steak was cooked perfectly medium and the scallops were seared just right. It was a great meal. It's not often that I clean my plate, but I ate all but a few bites of potatoes. Can't wait for another visit."
The Royal Scam,3,Stopped in today for lunch while we were downtown. A late lunch. Service was very fast. I ordered the bacon burger and wife ordered a spinach salad with chicken. The burger was tender and excellent however it was 13.00. Her salad was about the same price. Very tasty and quick but awful steep for a burger and fries. With as many choices as there are downtown I just don't see the prices lining up with value.
The Royal Scam,4,You know. Spring Mix is nice and convenient.  But mix it up a bit.  I'm trying to get a little bit of everything thing in so I can make a nice review on Yelp.  Ha ha ha. Spring mix it is.   All in all.   It's a nice place.  Nice attentive staff with some delicious foods delicious drinks.
The Royal Scam,4,Mixed drinks were expensive but very well balanced and delightful. Food was pricey as well and they let us order from the dinner menu early which was great.
The Royal Scam,5,Went to The Royal Scam on Saturday night 1/25.  Very busy but was seated quickly.  Mariah was our server and she did a outstanding job.  Great personality also.  We had the blackend redfish and filet.  Food was fantastic.  Perfect temp on the steak and the redfish was cooked perfectly.  Very impressed with this place.  Looking forward to going back.
The Royal Scam,3,"Definitely not a restaurant fit for royalty, much less a royal scammer. We came here during dinnertime, amidst construction surrounding the area the Royla Scam is located at. We had the Asian noodle salad with sauce on the side and the fish of the day. The fish of the day was decent, but not worth the price. The Asian noodle salad was disappointing. I usually ask for sauce on the side because many restaurants douse the food with sauce, and ruins the flavor of the food. Well my salad was flavorless... Because it was made up almost entirely of cabbage. The amount of cabbage was overwhelming relative to everything else, including the sauce. The sauce was too paltry to be able to save the rest of the salad from bland land. Other than the food, the interior was not much to write to home about. The restaurant was dark, and the customer base was made up mostly of old white guys watching football being shown on the TV. Parking is paid to park because this place is located at the downtown area."
The Royal Scam,5,"Another great visit at ""the Scam"". Our server, service and the food were all top drawer as usual.Just one note to add. ..The restaurant's phone system and voicemail were on the blink and after calling a few times during the afternoon without success decided to message the location. (Provided by Yelp site)The owner responded and confirmed they were open and provided guidance to complete our reservation."
The Royal Scam,2,"Quite a disappointing meal. Ordered crab cakes for an appetizer and they were just ok. Not bad but certainly nothing to shout about. Here is the bad part....I ordered salmon for my entree. Two others ordered salmon as well. The server asked them both how they wanted their salmon cooked. After she left I realized she didn't ask me. Oh well, I guess we will see. Well when the salmon came, it was definitely over cooked. It was hard and they tried to hide the burnt parts by turning it over. I tried to eat it but couldn't. So I sent it back and the replacement was not cooked quite as bad but still way over cooked. I picked at it but didn't eat much. I ended up ordering a basket of fries. Several tables around us got burgers and fries (traditional bar food). If I ever go back, that's what I will get....bar food. Leave the seafood and such to the experts."
The Royal Scam,4,The Royal Scam did not disappoint.   The drinks were great.  My husband loved their take on a Julep.  The food was scrumptious.   The only flaw was the temp on our steaks but since I am used to that particular flaw I was prepared.  Definitely recommend for natives and tourists.
The Royal Scam,4,"We dropped in for lunch on a recent Saturday. The place was cozy and not crowded. I wish we had waited until after 5:00 PM as the lunch menu did not have the options for steak that I was hoping for. I settled on the steak sandwich with Asian slaw and the spicy mango salad. My wife got the tossed salad with grilled shrimp. The food was good, the mango salad especially delicious which will bring me back by itself. Had the bread pudding for dessert which was quite good. Service was good. Just wish I could have had the steak. Parking was metered on the street, or paid parking lots around the corner."
The Royal Scam,5,Yummmm! The fish tacos are amazing and a MUST!  For my meal I got the steak sandwich which was delicious but not as good as the fish tacos. I tried two different sauces for the steak sandwich but didn't fall in love with either one of them.Wait staff was friendly at the bar and very helpful in picking things to try
The Royal Scam,3,"Worst server Lindsey M.  I eat there often as I work downtown.  Brought my daughter there who is visiting from Portland, OR.  Ljndsey was bubbly enough but not hitting the mark.  She asked if we wanted anything to drink.  I turned to my daughter and said, wine?  Not yet.  I said I'll take a tea.  We both got water which we did not ask for.  And with straws. . A few minutes later she asked if we were ready to order. Daughter:  IPA.  and we placed our dinner orders. 10 minutes later no IPA or tea.  Finally we asked another gentleman who seemed to be keeping an eye on everything about the IPA and tea. He finds her and she brings it.   I asked for Splenda. She brings it but only 1 pack.  I asked for more.  ""Oh sure!""  She then proceeds to wait on two more tables.  After another 10 minutes I flag down the nice gentleman again and he immediately obliged.  Ten minutes later we get our food.  She brings mustard and ketchup. Ketchup bottle is empty!  We ask for a bottle that actually has ketchup in it. We get some lame excuse that someone had just handed it to her.  Well, a blind person could have felt the bottle was empty.  She was extremely prompt to bring our ticket and stood there waiting as I reviewed the charges.  Rude. Rude. Rude.  She said she was waiting so no one else would ask her to do anything.  Guessing she can't multi-task. Wow. I've always had great service there.  I've been coming to Scam since they opened in 2006 as I work a block away and the steak sandwich is my go to lunch item.  It's always great as it was last night. Oh and the daughter asked for no onions on her burger since they were raw and not cooked. She got two or three.  I'll be back but I will definitely not sit in Lindsey M's section.  And please, ask your patrons if they want straws.  And please use recyclable to go boxes.  Styrofoam and plastic in a city that has a huge pile up of these items in our rivers and creeks is just not acceptable.  Dumbwaiter uses them. Why can't the Scam?"
The Royal Scam,5,"Very attentive service. Great location. Food was good, nice interior. We had the burger special and steak sandwich. Good."
The Royal Scam,4,"Good burgers and drinks. Ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with firs and a salad. The salad was light with spring greens almonds, apples, onions in a light dressing. The burger was hearty and hot, cooked just right. My SO ordered a salad with grilled chicken, less the onions, and was very happy. Not a lot of draft beer choices, but they have a good selection of bottled beers. Pretty decent wine selection as well.  Nice casual dinner spot and good service."
The Royal Scam,4,"Had dinner at the Royal Scam on a Saturday night.   There was a good sized crowd and the servers were attentive.   Went with the seafood gumbo and the filet with crab cakes.   Everything was good.  I made the mistake of not asking what the potatoes were that night.   It was sweet potatoe purée.   Not a fan of that but everything else was delicious.   That is on me,Not the restaurant."
The Royal Scam,5,What a great place for a meal. The food was delicious and staff was very attentive and friendly. I highly recommend the Pimento Cheese burger. They were able to get us seated immediately and treated our group with great hospitality being from out of town. The food was delicious.
The Royal Scam,3,"The prices didn't seem to match the quality of the food. I had chicken with a diced tomato topping which I could tell came out of a can. Chicken was good though.  The salmon you could tell was frozen because it took on the taste of the plastic wrapper and tasted extra fishy. I can understand it's expensive to run an establishment in such a hot spot, but a fresh tomato and salmon from the nearby ocean shouldn't cost too much."
The Royal Scam,5,A nice find!  I popped in here to enjoy a bite before going across the street to the Renaissance Hotel I'm glad I did
The Haberdasher,5,"This is our FAVORITE bar in Mobile! We have been many times, but I must say my favorite drink was had last night.The interior of this bar is so warm and inviting - almost like stepping back in time. They also serve food, although that's not what we are after when we come to the Haberdasher. We always have a great time here. The bartenders are friendly, make fabulous concoctions, and offer great conversation! If you are a fan of Jameson, get the Galway Hooker. It is exceptional! I also enjoyed a pour of Redbreast 12 yr Irish Whiskey, something I thought I wouldn't try again after having it in Dublin.Overall, this is a fun stop with great drinks if you are in the Mobile area!"
The Haberdasher,4,"Ok 100% love the atmosphere, and the menu. As soon as you walk in there's a ""serve yourself"" vibe, various signs... ""seat yourself"", ""counter service only"", you order separate from the bar & the kitchen. Like I said the menu is great, then they give you plastic ware... I'm not against plastic but this was a little shocking after being at so many restaurants in Tx that have switched to paper straws (which I hate), is it really too much to ask for silverware? There's rack of lamb on the menu! I would've been pissed if I ordered that and then discovered I had to eat it with a plastic fork & knife. Honestly! We ordered the sweet potato blue cheese chips, delicious! And the scotch egg & mussels and frites. The mussels had the fries floating around with the mussels which was different but it was good! The scotch egg was ok, I wouldn't order it again, I may have misread the menu but normally a scotch egg has pork sausage wrapped around it and this was hamburger so it really wasn't very flavorful. Ok so the set up is a little weird, however, this makes for a great intimate setting where someone isn't constantly coming to your table taking your food before you're done or interrupting your conversation. I like it. It's just different and no one likes change right?"
The Haberdasher,5,"We've been to Hab several times before, but this was our first time ordering food.  Do not make our same mistake and just go for cocktails because the food is fantastic!  They have a great mix of flatbreads, apps, tacos, etc.  We had the brussels sprouts, fish and chips, and chicken flatbread which were all very delicious."
The Haberdasher,4,"Stopped in for a quick drink and tried the ""Handbook for the Recently Deceased"" - which was as good as you might imagine. Sad that I didn't have more time to hang out but obviously a great spot worth spending some time in the next time I'm in town....."
The Haberdasher,4,The bartenders were great and the chicken sandwich was nice and spicy. Pops said he loved the burger. Check it out!
The Haberdasher,5,"Was in town for two nights and came here both. First night for happy hour. Great Old Fashioned, okay Margarita. Good local beer selection. Second night after dinner had a Galway Hooker. Delicious with a nice smoky flavor. Highly recommend. Nice crowd both nights. Good service."
The Haberdasher,4,The Haberdasher has a cool feel. The bartenders are pretty attentive. The food was pretty good.  I got a sandwich special the Mobile Spicy Chicken. If you like real drinks made by artisans this seems like a good place to go.  The night I was there they said it was kinda slow but the bar was still fullI wanted to try dessert because the buttercream cake or pie looked good but I was too full.
The Haberdasher,4,"A bit upscale, yet relaxed old-timey feeling place. Very good happy hour prices and selection. Tonight was the first time that I have gotten food here and experience was a bit odd. Firstly, there is no table service - I knew this and no big deal. However, I was already sitting at the bar having a drink with a running tab and wanted to order some food. Well, you can't do this at the bar. You have to order the food from the kitchen itself, pay for it in a separate transaction (PITA), pick up a buzzer and wait to be buzzed to pick up the food at the kitchen. My guess is that the kitchen is a separate, contracted business, but still this setup doesn't make it easy for the customer.I just ordered a simple cheeseburger and fries. Burger was a smash burger and was not bad, but nothing to write home about. Fries were hand cut and tasty. Fries came with a side of ""curry ketchup"" which seemed to be mayonnaise with curry powder (wasn't bad, but prefer regular ketchup, which was fortunately also available)."
The Haberdasher,5,"Amazing hand crafted cocktails! Seriously if you are looking for a adult bar with excellent service and phenomenal drink creations,give this place a try."
The Haberdasher,5,Stopped in here for a drink last Sunday for a drink. It was not too busy backside of the flu going around but that didn't stop the bar tender from chatting with us and giving us great advice. One of those places you feel bad saying bar tender because he was so much more than that! Made one of the best cocktails I've had in years. Also pizza was great. Go eat and drink here!
The Haberdasher,4,Delicious cocktails and a great happy hour. Food choices are limited and not attached to the bar itself.
The Haberdasher,5,"Craft cocktail heaven! Mobile has a go-to spot, and The Haberdasher is it! The cocktails are fresh, crafty, and well balanced. Anyone who dabbles (or fully engages, like myself) in craft cocktails can taste the difference and truly appreciate what The Haberdasher is serving up! They make a mean Pisco Sour and Moscow Mule, and the hubs also vouches for their Old Fashioned. I appreciate the fact that this place is quite popular and mainly stays crowded, but service is always stellar and the drinks are made well! It's a win/win and that's why I'm a fan!"
The Haberdasher,5,"Interesting and unique! This place is so different and always a great experience. There are so many different craft cocktail options, draft beer and great food too! They are constantly changing and improving their drink and food menus to give you a great experience every time. The setting is very cozy and classy as well!"
The Haberdasher,5,"While in town visiting a buddy, I stopped in after seeing the reviews and pictures of the place. When we got there we sat at the bar and were greeted by our bartender Beezy. She was very friendly and courteous and took our order. I ordered my customary Old Fashion w/Bulleit Rye and watched her make it. Nothing was muddled, not too sweet and large single ice cube was used so it was perfect. The interior of the place has a throw back look that sets the right ambience for this type of high end craft cocktail joint. It was clean and comfortable and a place you can relax at. Beezy was working on a new cocktail to add to the menu so she excused herself and introduced us to Sergio who would be taking over for her. Sergio was just as friendly and we started talking about various topics over the next hour or so we were there. He also made a mean Old Fashion and a great Sazerac. He mentioned to us that they have a kitchen that offered great food so we decided to try the burger and avocado fries. They were both delicious. Overall, when I'm back in town, this is the first place I'm looking forward to returning."
The Haberdasher,4,"Food was tasty -- just not sure about having to order drinks & meals at different countertops.  Also, I feel some their food item's prices were a bit exaggerated.  ($9 for a serving of fingerlings potatoes.). Maybe the a la carte Items are intended to be split between two ppl but still $9?I would recommend to sit at bar if you plan to have more than one adult beverage. Or if you would like water with your glass of wine.  The reason for 4 stars is due to price in relation to serving size. Friendly staff members."
The Haberdasher,5,"Super chill place, and the system of ordering at the bar, and kitchen in the back is absolutely brilliant, brilliant I tell you. If you fix that old piano, I'll play for fries , I'm  serious. Bring me those fries or arépas  until I pass out. I can really play too!"
The Haberdasher,3,"Early in the week it a great place!  Great service, location; knowledgeable bar tenders.   Thursday: busy or not: slow-almost nonexistent service.  I go to other local options!"
The Haberdasher,5,Wonderful! I ordered a Rose Nylund. It's was the most perfectly crafted artisan cocktail I believe I've ever had. The service was professional and respectful. The environment was clean and classy. This might be my new favorite place in Mobile :)
The Haberdasher,4,"Met a co-worker for happy hour. Awesome food and amazing cocktails! Enjoyed sitting at the bar watching bartenders make everyone's drinks. Very knowledgable bartenders. Great after work atmosphere. Not very noisy. Ordered from the spring menu. The nachos were ok, I guess I was thinking gameday nachos! Lol! The calamari and veggies were delish! Definitely 5 stars!"
The Haberdasher,4,"Great atmosphere! Good food and drinks.I loved the attention to detail, even the sinks in the restroom were repurposed leather suitcases. Too cool!"
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,"UPDATE: if you have not tried the king cake French toast (it is a seasonal item) you NEED TO! I'm not a huge French toast lover but I am a sucker for king cake. It is served with blueberries.. ah it's basically life changing.Visited the Ruby Slipper for breakfast and we were not disappointed! I have not been to the ones in Louisiana so I can't make the comparison for that. We came in around 10:30am on a Saturday and the wait was about 30 min for4 of us but I don't think it took the full 30 min. While you are waiting you can go to the bar and order drinks if you'd like, they will give them to you in plastic COLOR CHANGING CUPS!! The inner child in me came out, the cups turn red with cooler temperatures. We chose to be seated at first available so we were seated out at the back patio which was very nice. When you place your name on the waitlist they will ask for your number and you will receive a text when your table is ready. It will intitially text you with a link so that you can check your place in line, which I personally did not do so I cannot attest to the reliability of that.As for food, everyone was happy with their meals. 3 Peacemakers were ordered among the group, sampling 5 different options. The consensus is that the chicken was the best one. I tried it myself and was impressed. I ordered the pancake flight which was very good. It came with a blueberry crepe, the cinnamon pancake and the one with bacon. All three were very delicious, I was just sad I wasn't able to eat all of it! I'm not a big fan of crepes but I did like this one enough to eat half of it. My favorite pancake was the one with the bacon, I might just order that one by itself next time! We ordered the Ruby slipper mimosa, which is a good sized mimosa for $10 and delicious. Overall we had a great first visit and will return in the future!!"
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,"Wow, Yelp me please! Simply delicious and best choice we made before we headed out. The vibe of this place is fun and it's has a little bit of an old vibe too. They have a parking lot across the street and they also have street parking around. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the hostess and taken to our table. She brought a high chair for our little one. She was friendly and attentive. The whole staff that was there that morning, honestly. Our waitress came a little while after and took out order. She was friendly and super genuine. She was very knowledgeable about the food. The coffee was delicious and I want more. And they use cardboard straws for the environment. The scrambled eggs were delicious and on point! My baby vacuumed them, ha! The dill on the sauce wasn't overwhelming so I was sad for asking it to be placed on the side, but better safe than waste the food. The salmon had a great taste to it but it was a bit to scattered on the pan for too long so it wasn't moist. The chicken was juicy and tender but not crispy and not spicy. The biscuits could have been a bit softer on the edges but the dressing and sauce help moist it around. They have a full bar and offer brunch specials too. Tequila sunrise and Bloody Mary's, a few I saw around.The place was really clean and both bathrooms have changing tables in them! They have a gift shop section with stuff like cups, shirts, magnets, etc with their log for you to get if you want. Overall we definitely recommend and will make it a thing to stop every time!"
Ruby Slipper Cafe,4,Shrimp and grits is the dish I would order if I saw it on any restraurant's menu.flavor is 4 starquality of ingridient is 3 starService 5 star
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,So happy to have another breakfast restaurant downtown.  Mobile is growing leaps and bounds.   Food was good. Shrimp and grits was missing something.  I added crystal hot sauce that was on the table and was like BAMMMM!   That did it !!!Lol Thanks for being better that that other breakfast place on I-65.  You know what I'm talking about.  That country store.  Ha ha. I'm so glad to have some other options in our wonderful PORT CITY.  Options that are downtown.
Ruby Slipper Cafe,4,"Great food and service - but the wait staff as much longer than we were told.  I joined t he ""waitlist"" from this app and it was about double the expected time."
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,"I've had quite a few eggs benedict to date. I had no expectations coming here, but I think I had the most delicious benedict combination of my life so far at Ruby Slipper Cafe. I had the Peacemaker, where you can choose two different benedicts, so I went with the St. Charles (fried chicken) and the red eye ham (ham marinated in coffee and other spices), both over a huge biscuit and topped with a poached egg. The husband got the hot smoked salmon Benedict, which was also incredibly tasty. I think it's better than the average benedict, because they serve theirs over a biscuit instead of an English muffin and are topped with delicious and creative sauces as opposed to the regular Hollandaise. The service was incredibly friendly and helpful. The restaurant is very hip and cute. Looks like the building used to be in an old bank. A great breakfast/brunch find in downtown Mobile!"
Ruby Slipper Cafe,4,"Still in town for a conference and needed a quick lunch. Thankfully, Yelp let me know about Ruby Slipper Cafe. I sat at the bar and was waited on almost immediately. I ordered a coffee and the salmon Bennie. The coffee took a while, which I thought was curious, until I got it and realized they frothed it! Something different and not in a bad way!The Benedict was way more than I needed, so I suggest you come hungry. The eggs were perfectly poached, but the biscuit bed is really where the action was. Wow. Much of the spinach on the plate was rather wilted, so a little more attention to that detail would have made it a perfect experience."
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,"Super cute little place for breakfast, although they do have lunch options as well. It's in an old bank building, and they kept the original floors with the bank name designed into the tile. Very charming feature! We both ordered ""Morning Margaritas"" which to me, tasted more like a screwdriver with cranberry and grapefruit juice. I wasn't really a fan of it. I ordered the Bananas Forster Pain Perdue (minus the raisins) and it was pure perfection. It came with applewood bacon and I cleaned the plate. Not a single bite left. My husband ordered the Three Little Pigs omelette and it came with the biggest biscuit I've ever seen in my life. Photo doesn't do it justice. I tasted his omelette and it was delicious. Service was wonderful. The place was freezing though. Definitely take a sweater if you're prone to getting cold."
Ruby Slipper Cafe,4,"The food was as good as expected. The staff was kind and courteous. We have been to the Orange Beach location and decided to try the Mobile location because they had a special for kids. The kids got to decorate pancakes, which was pretty cool. I had the cinnamon swirl pancakes and they were really good."
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,"The Ruby Slipper Cafe is relatively new to Mobile, but it has already made itself one of the must-try restaurants.  I have visited about half a dozen times, and each time has been absolutely fantastic.  My biggest complaint is that I never know what to order - everything is so fantastic!I would highly recommend one of the benedicts; they are delicious and a good portion size.  I usually get the Peacemaker, which is a mix and match of any two benedicts.  I can never decide on just one benedict, so the Peacemaker helps me solve this issue.  I then typically decide between the Eggs Cochon, Chicken St. Charles, Corned Beef Bennie, or the daily special benedict.  You can't go wrong with any of these!I've also tried their pancakes, which were tasty.  You can also order a biscuit on the side for $2.  I wish they advertised this more!  I ordered one once and it was HUGE.  Next time, I am going to get one to go - it could be my whole dinner!"
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,"What a great dining experience. We were seated right away by the hostess who graciously offered to move us if the area was too drafty, it was a cold day. The server Gillis was pleasant and very knowledgeable about the menu. I like when the servers enjoy telling you about the menu items and make the food sound delicious. The food came out quickly and tasted great. The portions are big. The grits were really good, the texture and seasoning. I hope they make the biscuits and gravy a permanent menu item, it's a southern staple! The atmosphere was laid back, all the staff were nice and seemed to enjoy their jobs. I look forward to going back. Better than the location in New Orleans."
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,"The Ruby slipper cafe never disappoints! The food is great! The service is great, but the wait to be seated is always long on the weekends. I can not take away a star for the wait because it was worth it. Just take someone that you can have interesting conversation with!"
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,"This place is freaking amazing. My husband and I went to the location in New Orleans a few years back, and when I saw that they had another one in Mobile, I put it at the top of my must do list. The service was phenomenal - the waiter was very very friendly. I also ordered a bloody Mary and the special eggs Benedict, and both were delicious. I had plenty to take with me for lunch today - the portions are much bigger than I remembered!"
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,"Ruby Slipper Cafe inMobile is awesome. I visited this location for an Elite Yelp event and I had a wonderful time. We made biscuits from scratch. It was a merry good time with all the candied bacon, sunrise margaritas and biscuits galore. They staff was extra NICE! I loved the tour of the super clean kitchen and the history lesson behind the Ruby Slipper. A hidden gem we unlocked is that this location has phenomenal courtyard area. It was immaculate to the eye.I can't wait to visit again maybe during my lunch break to try some of their other menu items."
Ruby Slipper Cafe,1,What has happened to Ruby Slipper?? Bad day or bad new management?? Ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with fries like I have many times before as I am not a breakfast food person. The fries were stone cold. Like hard stale cold. The TINY piece of fried chicken was burnt and grease was literally oozing from it. I sent it back for a redo. The fries came back hot but it was the exact same piece of burnt chicken only they had added another tiny piece of burnt and greasy chicken beside it. Server offered to take it back again but in my opinion what's the use? Gave you two chances to get it right and you failed miserably both times. I'm leaving hungry and disappointed.
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,"This is a Fabulous place for breakfast or brunch. We had a party of 10 and our waiter Maurice was very helpful and patient with us. He told us their specials and his favorite dishes. He took good care of us. The coffee here is hot and fresh. Every dish our party had was delicious. I had the Hot-Smoked Salmon Benni"" it was very flavorful and cooked just right. I also tried a bite or 2 (or 3) of the French Toast, Shrimp and Grits, The Costa Rican (with black beans and fried plantains) I'll definitely be getting that again and also the ""Candied Bacon""... Oh my goodness the candied bacon! If you are a meat eater this is a must have! Absolutely delicious! We were pleased with everything we tried And will be back My husband and I just came here again for a biscuit making class.We sampled the Candied Bacon drizzled with chocolate ganache and it was a pleasantly addictive. Then we sipped on a beautiful glass of Ruby Slipper Pomegranate Mimosa which was great. I've never been able to make a biscuit from scratch. I've tried many time and only rocks come out of my oven. This was a great class! They talk up through it and demonstrated how The Ruby Slipper does biscuits (which they always make fresh throughout the day so you know you're getting a fresh fluffy biscuit when you come here). My husband and I worked as a team and couldn't believe our biscuits turned out good. They were even better once we added the cane butter and strawberry preserves. Oh my! So yummy!We had a wonderful time. Thank you again to everyone that worked so hard to make it great."
Ruby Slipper Cafe,3,I must admit I've had better experiences here.  I guess the newness has worn off. Didn't see the manager here this time and she's usually really visible. Maybe she was in the kitchen helping out.  We waited at the bar and had to literally wave down the bartender to get a drink and coffee.  Victoria did a great job serving us. Our biscuits were very tough. I had to ask for a knife to cut mine.  I've cut mine with a fork in the past. The food didn't seem as fresh as it has in the past and my friends fries were cold and her husbands food was cold but he didn't send it back because he didn't want to wait any longer.  Disappointed is an understatement.  This is where my husband wanted to eat brunch for his birthday. At least the drinks were good.
Ruby Slipper Cafe,4,"I was never interested in visiting the ruby slipper in Nola because the lines were always so ridiculous. But there was no wait at this location and was immediately seated. We had the trifecta Benedict and shrimp and grits. Both were scrumptious, but we would've preferred if the Benedict's were on English muffins. The homemade biscuit is too filling and we felt wasteful afterwards."
Ruby Slipper Cafe,5,So we got off the boat early thank you Carnival and mobile for having a fabulous port. We had eaten here before so we decided to check it out again and I am so glad we did... holy crap it was way better than I remember it being! The staff was super friendly the air conditioning was on and the food was on point. I think this establishment is decorated super cute and I think their menu it's pretty darn fabulous. Keep up the good work and we'll see you next year before our cruise!
Ruby Slipper Cafe,4,The food was great; servIce was slow  but they were very busy! This was our first experience at the Mobile location. The wait was long but worth it! Warning the pig candy was sweet.
Roma Cafe,5,Delish!!! Can't say enough great things about this place!! The price was great as well as the service! Update: went back. Our server was Colton and he was phenomenal!!! Everyone working out front was friendly and upbeat. The service alone is so great that The food could be absolute garbage and I'd still come back 1000 times... but don't worry the food is amazing!! They have a large menu for the size of the restaurant and the prices are great! We were just expecting a quick dinner but it was an incredible experience that put us in a better mood than when we arrived.
Roma Cafe,4,"One of the highest rated places in Mobile, lives up to the reputation. Fantastic Manicotti but pretty average appetizers. Would've loved some in-house made Italian deserts but sadly the waiter told me they were bought. Still worth a try though!"
Roma Cafe,5,"Love this place !  It's an inexpensive Italian restaurant.  That also has subs and the best fries . Oh , and hummus too , crazy huh ?  I think my three favorite things on the menu so far are the chicken parmesan , hummus , and fries ."
Roma Cafe,5,"Wow. Have I been passing a jewel by because of the outside cover. One day I will learn to stop doing that. Roma Cafe is in an older shipping center that is a little run down. I have been avoiding the place since there is an adult shop next door. The parking lot is ample, but in a bit of disrepair. Access is easy from both eastbound and westbound Airport Blvd. The inside is a bit plain and dark, but we were immediately greeted and sat in a comfortable booth. There are tables and outside seating in addition to the booths. Our drink orders were taken as the menus were being placed in front of us. We ordered Bruschetta and garlic bread with Alfredo sauce as appetizers. The bruschetta was crispy and warm with a cold salad of tomatoes, garlic, onions, olive oil and basil. It was wonderful. The garlic bread came out as crostini slices with a warm, tasty Alfredo sauce. I ordered the spaghetti shamino, a delicious sauce of tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic and jalapeños over spaghetti. I added meatballs, which were moist, tender and tasty. The sauce was thick enough to eat with a fork and I loved it. I love sauces that don't run off the pasta when you eat it. My wife had the shrimp Alfredo. She was pleased with the taste and the amount of shrimp on the plate. The accompanying salads were delicious too. We were too stuffed to try the chocolate chip cannoli that was calling out names. There were enough leftovers for another meal for each of us. Service was excellent. Out drinks were never empty and plates were cleared as we finished them. With another entree ordered to go, total was $60 with tip.We will definitely be back and bring the rest of the family with us. You must absolutely try this place."
Roma Cafe,2,"I really hate to give two stars but if nothing else I'm honest.  This little place has that small town dive diner feel to it with generic decor.  The service was superb, hence the second star, because without the great staff they get one star.  The meal was... Fair. Definitely not great.  I had the house salad and afterwards the Chicken Parm. The chicken tasted like pre-frozen breaded patties from one of the big box stores. It was also pretty dry. The penne was cooked to my liking and the marinara was just okay.  I seriously can't see myself returning."
Roma Cafe,5,"I have only been here two times, but I am sold on giving it five stars!The first time I came here, I got the Parmesan Tilapia De Roma and my wife got the Chicken Parm.  The restaurant is smaller than I imagined it would be on the inside, but the food was good and the staff were nice.  It has a very local feel - in a good way.  The second time I went put it over the top.  We went for their Wednesday cheesesteak deal - any cheesesteak, fries, and a drink for $8.99.  I wasn't expecting much, but wow!  Their cheesesteak is definitely the best in Mobile.  The fries were tasty and warm; the cheesesteak is big; meat is good; and they have several different types to order.  What else could you want!?I will certainly be back here in the future - especially for cheesesteak Wednesdays!"
Roma Cafe,5,"Just yum! After having it bookmarked since moving here, I finally came in for a lunch date! Boy, was I impressed! The servers are attentive and helpful in offering recommendations, and their kitchen is a well oiled machine as we were in and out with ample time to spare. Roma Cafe is the bomb and their seafood cannelloni won't soon be forgotten! OMG! SO GOOD!"
Roma Cafe,5,"This little cafe is a great spot for lunch. We reserved the patio for a party of 25 for a Sunday. The hostess welcomed and seated us immediately. Surprisingly one server was able to take care of our group and he did so very well (sorry that I cannot remember his name!) He got everyone's order correct and the food arrived fast, so kudos to the kitchen. Hubs had a cheesesteak and fries, and he raved about the sandwich! I barely was able to sneak a little bite. I went for the shrimp Alfredo, and it was very good too. The lunch portion came with a side salad and bread. I ended up taking about half of the Alfredo home, as it was a very large portion. We love Roma Cafe, and will definitely be back. Everything was delicious and fresh."
Roma Cafe,5,"If I ever want Italian food, I have officially found the place to go! A very cute, small restaurant that is big in flavor. I ordered the chicken Alfredo pasta, it was AMAZING! Typically Alfredo for me is kind of hit or miss, but they really nailed it. The sauce was plenty creamy and the chicken very flavorful. The pasta itself was cooked to perfection.My fiancé order the chicken parm, it was fabulous as well. The marinara sauce was delicious as was the chicken. Both of our entrees came with salad, the Italian house dressing is a MUST! I need to find out if they sell this stuff in bottles because wow, I need more of it in my life. There is a nice constant stream of garlic bread brought to the table as well, perfect for dipping in the sauce!Staff was very friendly & prices were great. Can't wait to go back!"
Roma Cafe,5,"This is the textbook definition of a hole in the wall. Yet another restaurant to grace the beautiful road that is Airport lies a small Italian restaurant with delicious fare. Even with a full house, the wait was maybe 15 minutes on a Friday night. As we were seated I took a look at their menu and was surprised by the prices of all these different Italian dishes. Usually, I pay 15 or so for just a regular pasta but for this price, you could buy a veal or chicken parmigiana... I was ecstatic. I ended up trying out their veal parmigiana because I've always wanted to try it. When they brought it out I was stunned honestly. They brought out this huge plate filled with a huge veal cutlet and and penne pasta. It passed the eye test with flying colors! I went ahead and ate the pasta first and was met with a sweet, flavorful tomato sauce... absolute perfection! This paired with the veal was just heaven! I was super full after eating half so you'll definitely have leftovers. Great service, even better food makes for a great night! I'll definitely be coming back here!"
Roma Cafe,5,This place is one local joint I can really recommend to friends visiting from out of town. It never fails to be a hit. I LOVE the Cheesesteaks. Especially the one with jalapeños and mushrooms. Maybe it's called 911? YUMMERS!! Their side salad is substantial with homemade tasting ranch and blue cheese dressings. The spaghetti is really tasty! And the garlic bread is made of the same sandwich hoagie bread as the Cheesesteaks which is crusty and chewy at the same time. Really good food here!!
Roma Cafe,4,Great lunch spot. 8-9 bucks for a huge sandwich and fries. The cheese steaks are great also the chicken parmigiana sandwhich is huge. Take a look at the pics and decide for yourself.
Roma Cafe,4,I really enjoy this local restaurant! The food is always good and I enjoy everything on their menu! The best part is their pasta is imported from Italy! Spaghetti is great. I get it every time! Love it
Roma Cafe,5,It's located in an okay location but the food is absolulty amazing. I have tried several Italian places before but I still come back here every single time. They are absolutely amazing. The staff is really friendly and you don't have to wait a long time for the food to come out. I have gotten the baked ziti before and the spaghetti marinara and both of them were really good. I've taken about five people here and every person loves it.
Roma Cafe,3,"My husband and I sure did want to love ""Roma Cafa"" and we were looking forward to eating here. We left a bit disappointed. We may try it again sometime and get something completely different off the menu. Definitely a non-pasta dish for me next time.The service was good. Our waitress was accommodating and we were never in need of anything. Our food came out quickly and the restaurant was busy and clean. We were happy so far...I ordered the ""Seafood Manicotti"". I had high hopes when it came out bubbling with hot cheese. Anybody that knows me knows that I love cheese, but for the first time in my life I have experienced too much cheese. There were only two manicotti pasta stuffed with ricotta in the dish, surrounded with cheese and greasy oil topped with more cheese. Now normally this would sound great to me, but it grossed me out about three bites in. It was just solid bites of cheese. There was very little pasta or anything other than cheese in this dish. As for the seafood part, there were about five shrimp on top that were very flavorful and delicious. However, it seems like they should call this ""Shrimp Manicotti"" not ""Seafood Manicotti"" since I was not able to find any other seafood in my dish whatsoever. I ate about a quarter of my dish, got it to go and I felt a bit uneasy to my stomach every time I thought about it.The price for my husband and me to eat lunch here was around $30 before tax and tip. We  each had an entrée and only ordered water to drink. For the style and atmosphere of this restaurant the prices seemed a bit high.Again, I might come back and try one of their sandwiches or a non-pasta dish and maybe I will love them. For now though, this is my opinion."
Roma Cafe,5,"Great food, casual atmosphere. While they don't serve alcohol their sweet tea makes up for it! We had two appetizers, the shrimp scampi and the spinach pastry. For the main course we split a lasagne, which I asked them to cook it longer than usual since I like it well done. They complied and all the food was delicious & the service was excellent."
Roma Cafe,4,"I enjoy going to Roma cafe once in a while when I'm in the mood for pasta. I really wish they had pizza as well, I'd be here more often. I recommend fried calamari as the appetizer, house dressing for the salad, and shrimp scampi for the main. Their shrimp scampi is very delicious. There are 14 large shrimps and unlike other shrimp scampi's, it's not a buttery mess. Their food is less Americanized and more authentic than any Italian restaurants in Mobile. If you're not stuffed by the end of your meal, I recommend the tiramisu. Well actually you can't leave without having it!Dishes I've tried (from best to not so great): Shrimp scampi- always a good choice Tuscana grilled salmon- salmon is cooked perfectly with angel hair with pesto Chicken Alfredo- pretty goodEggplant Parmesan- not bad Seafood manicotti- decent but small in portionMeat lasagna- decent but not remarkableChicken Parmesan- Not a fan of their tomato based sauces, and the chicken was very saltyMeatball Parmesan sub- meatball is dry and not very flavorful"
Roma Cafe,5,"I've been meaning to check this place out for a while, and boy am I glad I finally have. My favorite dish from this restuarant is the chicken Parmesan. The dish was about $14 or so. The price was shocking to me considering the pasta is imported from Italy, and their portion size is enough for me to have 3 meals. Some of the entrees come with a salad, which you have the option to substitute with fries, onion rings, or steamed vegetables (tip: I don't think they mention you're allowed to do this on menu.) I substituted once, and you would think it'd be just a small portion, but no they give a substantial amount. If you like amazing food with a huge proportion and a good price...you should check this place out. It's very cute on the inside too. Perfect for a casual date night. The service is fast and excellent! And for my 21+ people, they do not serve alcohol in case you're into that type of thing. The menu pricing doesn't change between lunch and dinner, so it's perfect to check out at anytime!"
Roma Cafe,4,I can say this is one of my favorite Italian restaurant. Food is full of flavor. Must try if you like Italian food.
Roma Cafe,3,"I tried this place for the first time and had the Chicken Alfredo. My problem was that I couldn't see the bowl of pasta for the sauce poured on top. It was drowned in Alfredo, way too much in my opinion. At $13.99 a bowl, I thought it was a bit pricey for what I got. We spent $29.68 before tip on two entree's that came with side salads.That being said, I had no problem with the service. Our server was very nice, got our order in promptly and checked on us more than once. The portion size was large, so I did get plenty of food. And I would try them again since they had several sandwiches on the menu that looked interesting."
Gwen’s House,4,"After reading about Gwen's House, I wanted to give it a try. I'm glad I did. The hostess and waitress were pleasant and shared the day's specials as I was seated. The lunch menu featured three entrees as well as appetizers, sides, and Banana Pudding. I ordered fried chicken with mashed potatoes/gravy and green beans. The portions were generous. The chicken was well-seasoned and delicious. The gravy complimented the mashed potatoes. The green beans were loaded with chunks of sausage and a bit of heat (which I liked). The service was a bit slow for lunchtime (getting back to work on time might be a problem)but I didn't mind as the food was served hot.I ordered banana pudding to go.Gwen's House is a nice addition to the area and well worth a visit."
Gwen’s House,1,"Do not waste your time coming here unless you like instant tea, corn from a can, and instant potatoes. It was really salty. We were not offered a refill on the horrible tea.  When the corn came out it looked like it had soaked in dirty water. The yams had way too much cinnamon and a weird taste. The gravy was from a jar. They do not have a liquor license because they have a bar with any adult beverages. The building was not remodeled and looks like a dirty Applebee's inside. The music was nice. The hostess was nice."
Gwen’s House,3,Been excited since hearing about this place opening and finally got the pleasure of eating here. I enjoyed my meal even though the two food items I was very much interested in trying were not on the menu. Big portions (maybe not for everyone but for me at least). Very tasty and delicious!! My husband however was very disappointed we never got a refill on our drinks with our waitress walking past 4 times with empty glasses on the table it is quite literally one of his biggest pet peeves when it comes to restaurant service. He was not impressed at all with what he ordered.
Gwen’s House,5,"01/08/2020 @ 7:30pmNot sure how this place has 3 stars but I'm here to fix that. I'm an over the road driver and I love food, my Yelp Collection is crazy. From A View/Atmosphere - You can tell it used to be an Applebee's from the structure. Nice Bleu signs saying ""Gwens House "" and "" Yung Bleu Soul Food Restaurant "". Booths, High Chairs and Bar Seating. Lighting was dim so it's a relaxing feeling. Mixture of Old Skool & Current R&B playing. I was on the phone the whole time and it was terribly loud, granted it is a Wednesday. Bathroom was clean and stocked with the essentials. Greeters and Servers did well. I got the "" Give Me Those Chopz "" Fried with the two sides of Mac & Cheese and Collard Greens. It was presented fairly well, I mean it's simple. Tried the Pork Chop first it was very crunchy like fried chicken, I give that a 5  rating. Next was the Mac & Cheese,it was definitely baked with care. Not to cheesy and very flavorful. ( oh not once did I use salt or pepper ) I give this a 4 1/2  rating. Last but not least The Collard Greens. Not many soul food places over the road serve collards so of course I had to try. ( I do believe it contains pork ) I was very surprised for this I didn't have to use any seasoning. Does have a little kick but nothing too crazy. I also give this a 5  rating. Overall great meal would definitely get it again. My only recommendation is possibly adding a bread to the entree.  I will be recommending this place to all of my friends and hope this review helps people get a feel of the place."
Gwen’s House,5,The food was seasoned to perfection. The fish was served hot and tasty. The macaroni and cheese was phenomenal.
Gwen’s House,4,"Soul food is always my go to, so when I heard Yung Bleu was bringing a soul food establishment to the city, I knew I had to try it. I went in on a not so busy day, during Mardi Gras, for a nice lunch. The service was absolutely amazing and friendly. Everyone I encountered made me feel like I was back home. My food was amazing. Hot and fresh. I'm really picky when it comes to my candied yams, and they were amazing. Chicken seasoned to perfection. I'll be making my way back there soon."
Gwen’s House,2,"Super disappointed about this one. Food quality was not good and the price point was to high for the meal. I had the beef tips with cornbread dressing and collard ax the beef tips were fine, but the dressing had 4 bones in it! The greens were bitter and just not good. The two others that dined with me had the wings and the meatloaf. Both stated that the meal was waaaay to salty and just not good. I hate to rate this place so low and do not make it a habit of low ratings without giving a second chance. I will give it one more try in a month or two and hopefully I can increase my stars."
Gwen’s House,2,"I have passed this place often and thought it might b time to give it a try.  Well, I went in with an open mind and no preconceived thoughts.  The waitress was very nice and professional. The place seemed to b very clean   However.   The price of the food was very overpriced!!!  I had the grilled pork chops which was very salty, fresh green beans which also were way too salty, and the only food which was eatable we're the French fries.  My husband had the meatloaf which was again, way too salty. The mashed potatoes were just ok. The music was so loud u couldn't speak. I can say I tried it and will not return."
Gwen’s House,3,As much as I want to try this place.....I'm not spending 13.99 on a 6 piece wings and 2 sides. Sorry. Just not doing it. I'll go to Mamas place downtown and get a huge meat and 2 veggie for 9.99 all day every day. I want to support this place. I love the location but at that price sorry not happening. The greens could be made of solid gold and best on the planet but still won't be worth 14.00 for lunch.  I understand charging more for your oxtail lunch that's a speciality and maybe getting 14.00 for that. But a meat and 2 veggie I in west mobile for lunch has got to be 10.00 or under or it won't stay in business. Hope this helps the owners. Pics look good. But the cheapest lunch is 14.00 not even gonna try it. Sorry.
Gwen’s House,4,"I've been here 3 times and had the pork chops all 3 times.  Had fried pork chops twice and grilled once. (I wanted to try the meatloaf during one of my visits but they were out of it.)Both the fried and grilled were excellent!  Best I've had in a long time! Had collard greens, mashed potatoes and gravy, macaroni and cheese and boiled cabbage as sides during my three visits. And each was so good!!!  Service was excellent!The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the cost of sides if you want an extra side.  At $4.99 each I think that's a bit pricey. The portions are just average and would barely be enough for one person."
Gwen’s House,4,"The food was pretty good!!  It was close to ""mama's home cooking"".  Wait staff was very friendly and fast.  We went at lunchtime and each of us (3) had the chicken wings.  We got 2 sides each and 6 drumettes for $13.99.  The wings are fried pretty well.  Nice texture and crunch.  The Mac and cheese and cornbread dressing each had a very good flavor and I would definitely order again.  The green beans and were THE BOMB!  They were a little bit spicy with sausage but still very good!  The yams were good as well.  Overall we really enjoyed our time and will definitely be going back soon!"
Gwen’s House,4,I'm being generous with this rating just because of their recent opening. I see growth for this eatery and real good upside. The food was good but could use work. I had the oxtails and rice with a side of mac and cheese. Oxtails had great flavor but weren't thoroughly cooked to ensure correct tenderness. They had great flavor though! The Mac and cheese was good also. Would've been great if they wouldn't have put unmelted cheese on the top which changed the texture of the food and made it seem somewhat dry. We also had the fried chicken wings with Mac and cheese with yams. The chicken wings and yams were excellent! I will be back!
Gwen’s House,2,"Been looking forward to trying this place since it opened. Heard mixed things about the food. Talked my boss into going there for a district meeting. It took nearly 15 min for someone to seat us although 3 different people told us they would seat us ""shortly"". Finally got to a table and was seated under a light that was flash right in my eyes which was annoying. I watched several different employees come out and remove dishes and trash from tables but not wipe them off. Just in my direct eye sight I saw 6 tables with crumbs left on them. My waitress ended up having to wipe those tables down nearly a hr later so she could seat other guests. The waitress that took care of us knew all about the menu and made several suggestions to us. We both chose the meatloaf. When it came out I must admit the display looked beautiful. Very colorful and everything was scooped onto the plate beautifully. We got very excited. Then we took the first bite and were sadly disappointed. The meatloaf was way over salted and had too many flavors going on at one time. The mashed potatoes had no salt at all. The Mac and cheese was terrible, I didn't take more than two bites. We wrote the place off immediately and will not be back. For a ""soul food"" restaurant I was very disappointed. I give it two stars for the waitress and the display of the food."
Gwen’s House,1,I'm  a chef of 27 yrs I decided to dining here today. Well I order the gumbo and two sides. The gumbo was the worst I've ever tasted or even seen. The mac and cheese dry and over cook the collards were actually really good. I work in new Orleans and eat a lot of soul food. I expected a lot better quality of food coming from soul food.
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"I enjoy Yuan Mei! The food and flavors are pretty solid. The staff is attentive and great at guiding menu choices. Their lo mein, fried rice, and egg rolls are my personal favorites and it's great that they're currently open for takeout and curbside pickup during the period of social distancing for patrons. Happy to continue to support this local biz!"
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"I have ordered delivery from Yuan Mei several times now during this stay in place. The menu offers a wide range of authentic chinese dishes beyond the standard beef and broccoli and Kungpao chicken or the ubiquitous buffet places in Mobile and the South and Midwest in general. I have had their Taiwanese braised pork and it was spot on. I was surprised that they had crispy intestines( think of them as crispy and airy sausages) on their menu. The cumin lamb and beef in black bean sauce was spot on. Their fish in black bean sauce was interesting accommodation to local food culture. Instead of a lightly battered white fish chopped bite-size, it offered a full deep fried fish fillet. I plan to try their beef noodle soup and basil squid next. Great place!"
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"Normally when the hubs and I have a craving for Asian style food, it's on a Monday when our fav (Asian Garden) is closed.. which leads us to explore outside of our bubble. We decided to give this place a try because of all the positive yelp review, they did not disappoint!I went with the honey chicken because of the reviews, it was good! I subbed my rice for lo mein (give it a try if you like noodles), great choice because their lo mein is delicious. Their chicken has the fried outer layer, a yummy texture with the right amount of crunch.My other half ordered the sesame chicken, which was eerily similar to the honey chicken, with our experience sesame chicken is usually a safe choice when trying a new place. Don't get me wrong, the sesame chicken was good but the honey was better.The spring rolls are good as well!Definitely will be returning, I already know I want to try the orange chicken."
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,1,If I could give -10 stars I would. When we ordered from this Chinese food restaurant we did not expect the type of food that was delivered to us. When we first got our food it's smelled quite good and to be honest from the looks of it it looked pretty delicious but looks can be very deceiving. Their fried rice is the equivalent Of taking dirty dishwater putting it on top of rice dumping it into an old boot frying it and then putting it into a serving container. This is probably the worst General Tso's chicken I have ever had in my life and it leaves a God awful aftertaste I cannot even describe and the textured is like deep fried rubber. I cannot understand how this restaurant has such good reviews it was truly terrible. Will never order from here again. We would ask for a refund but are sure that we would not receive it. Hopefully no one else has this experience.
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"There are restaurants that do well enough that you say to yourself; ""I'll come back."" Then there are restaurants that make you say, ""I'll make a special trip just to come back here."" Yuan Mei is the latter for me. Located in the same shopping center as Publix at the intersection of Hillcrest and Cottage Hill, Yuan Mei is easy to get to with plenty of traffic signals and turn lanes to assist. The parking lot is large, clean, and well maintained. I was more than pleasantly surprised at the decor. Nicely decorated and not cliche either. Nice tables and booths with plenty of room. It's cozy in Yuan Mei. While perhaps not quite intimate, it's better than most places these days. There is no buffet and that made me quite happy. That means the food is cooked to order. I often believe that buffets have destroyed what was once a delicious cuisine and relegated it to the level of let's not get Chinese tonight. Because there is no buffet here you get to experience the flavor of freshly cooked dishes they way they are supposed to taste. And man, is it good. The menu is very large with options for just about anyone. We started with crab and cheese Rangoon. There were 8 with a tasty sweet dipping sauce. We also ordered a bowl for two of the Seafood Hot and Sour Soup. Let me tell you. I am a soup snob. This was one of the best soups I have ever eaten. I think I will have it as my meal next time we come.I had the Kung Pao Combination, an absolutely delicious mix of beef, chicken and shrimp with zucchini, mushrooms and a light brown sauce with a sprinkle of peanuts on top. This was accompanied by a bowl of white rice. I just wish it had been a bit more spicy, but it was already so good I didn't care at the time. My wife got the  shrimp with rice noodles. I had a taste. It was fantastic. And, there was so much food we had plenty for another meal later that evening. The service was wonderful. Price was $50 with tip. I will make a trip just to come here - an hour or so from the house. It's THAT good.  Try it."
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,4,"Good food and they even customized a chow foon order to make it ""Singapore Chow Foon"" which is a combination cooked with curry. We also ordered General Tso's chicken and Kung Pow shrimp. Both are labeled as ""spicy"" but they are not, only the peppers they add to them are a little spicy and they are easy to remove if you don't like spice. I am a huge critic or General Tso's and Chinese in general but their recipe is pretty good. Not too much breading on the General Tso's either. Crab Rangoon is good too!"
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"This is a great place for some really good Chinese food. Seriously! Huge portions are made fresh when ordered.The location is in a strip mall off Hillcrest Rd. and Cottage Hill in the shopping center with Publix. It's hiding in plain sight.The customer service was terrific. I was greeted when I walked in and was certainly tempted to take a seat but I was in a hurry and just wanted grab a bite. The menu offers a lot. It's really something for everyone. I chose to the honey chicken and rice. The honey chicken was the best I'd ever had in town.  The flavors, the portions, and the chunks of breast made this more than enough food for one.This just might quickly be my favorite Chinese Restaurant. To go or eat in, you can go wrong."
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"Five stars for great service and perfectly seasoned food. There aren't a lot of great choices for Chinese food in Mobile, but this place is will be my go-to when I'm in the mood for it. We were first served a complimentary chicken teriyaki skewer. I don't think this will be something they always do, but it was a nice touch for a new-ish restaurant. They've been open about three months now.My daughter wanted the wonton soup, which is served in a large bowl at $5.95 for two people, but it could easily serve four, especially if you're going to order an entrée. They use shrimp wontons that both of us enjoyed. The soup is very flavorful without being overly seasoned. For entree's, we ordered the triple delight with brown sauce and steamed white rice, plus a kid's sweet and sour chicken. The triple delight was chicken, beef, and shrimp with sugar snaps, mushrooms, and broccoli. Both meals were huge portions. I'd recommend sharing if you can get your partner to agree on a dish. Otherwise hopefully you like leftovers. My favorite thing is that they didn't over season anything and they don't use MSG. I didn't walk out of there feeling like I needed a dose of blood pressure medication. When I told the server how I appreciated that they didn't over season everything she said they they go light on seasoning, but you can always ask for extra if you like spicy. She also mentioned that they can make diabetic friendly dishes upon request."
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"I've been meaning to write a review for a while, but I LOVE this place. We get it about once or twice a month, and it's always ready quickly and freshly made. The menu has a great variety of options - I highly recommend the steamed dumplings and egg rolls for appetizers! I have yet to find something I don't like. The staff is so sweet and accommodating, and are always wanting to make sure their customers are taken care of. They also make their food with no MSG, so you never feel overstuffed after eating! I will absolutely continue ordering from here for both the high quality service and food."
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,3,Sorry this place just doesn't do it for me. I got the moo goo guy pan with egg drop soup and fried rice. Wife got king pow chicken with fried rice and hot and sour soup. Both off of the lunch menu. The eggs rolls were not very good. My moo goo was not very flavorful. The egg drop had tomatoes in it ‍. Wife liked hers. Price was pretty good at 6.95-8.95 for lunch. But very generic blah Chinese. Nothing special. Sorry
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"Lunch menu pricing is cheap and the food is excellent. Spring roll, egg drop soup and chicken lo mein (Hugh portion) was very good. Chopped fresh chicken, not usual thinly sliced pieces.Atmosphere is nice and clean.Waitress was very good also.Lunch $7.25."
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"The staff is really friendly. I ordered an advanced To Go order. They had it ready on time and it was hot and freshly made. I got the Honey Chicken lunch special. The portions were generous, very good value for the price. The honey chicken was really good, the sauce was nicely seasoned and the chicken was crispy. The fried rice was good as well. I will definitely be back!"
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"I tried this place for the first time this week and there are a number of things I really liked about it.First off, this was a to go order - orange chicken and pork fried rice.- I was happy to see that the orange chicken came pre-mixed. Lots of other Chinese restaurants send the sauce and chicken home in two different containers which really takes something off the experience.- The fried rice came in a large rectangular container, like something you'd put your leftovers in at IHOP and it was STUFFED with fried rice. I ate this for 5 days.- This is the first time I've ever actually tasted the orange in orange chicken, which was fantastic. There were bits of peel mixed in which, although bitter, certainly added to the taste. I definitely want to have this again.- The fried rice was perfectly moist. It wasn't mushy but it wasn't dry. Plenty of vegetables in it (I had mine without onions). Plenty of pork as well.What I'd say was my favorite about it was that it all re-heated exceptionally well. That's typically a draw-back for Chinese food, particularly fried rice. It may taste great now but the second (or fifth, in this case) time around it'll usually be dry and almost crunchy. Both the orange chicken and the fried rice were the same moist texture every time I re-heated them. Loved it. I've been going to the Asian Garden regularly and have been fairly underwhelmed. Thanks Yuan Mei for knocking it out of the park. It's also less than 5 minutes from my house. Bonus!"
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"Kind of hidden from street view, but one of my absolute favorite restaurants! Fantastic food and quick, friendly service! Lots of options and never disappoints"
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"I've looked for a good Asian spot the couple years I've lived here, and I just haven't been able to find one. I don't like overly fried, Americanized Chinese food that looks like it came from a frozen container; and this spot is far from that. Everything we've had is made fresh to order. Their fried rice is so good, along with their spring rolls. We've had the moo goo gai chicken, Mongolian beef and Kung pao chicken; and it's all soo good. They let you customize it however you'd like, and make sure you get exactly what you want. Quiet, dimmed seating area. Staff is very nice, too!"
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"The best Chinese food in town. Their spicy boiled beef in hot oil is the best, as well as their lo mein."
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,4,Ok I was looking for some Chinese food late on Saturday and I found this place thanks to Yelp. Not bad to be honest I ordered some crab Rangoons which were decent and also had their Cumin Lamb and it was great a bit salty but once you mix it with the noodles or the rice it was ok. The portions are huge and the service was really good. They seems to have a lot of options for food so I will go and check some other dishes later.
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"This place is a hidden gem.   First, the restaurant is very clean and the staff is extremely friendly.   Great lunch specials 7 days a week includes soup, egg roll and rice.   Dine in specials like ""free iced tea"" often occur.  But the best part is the food ... it is the best Chinese food in Mobile.    The Mongolian beef and chicken is outstanding.  Great lo mein and lots of noodle dishes to choose from.  Everything we have tried is good.  Tofu options as well.   It's in a shopping center so it's easy to miss ... but definitely worth a visit.    I hope it's around for a long time."
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Mobile! The food is amazing and the service is great! I'm obsess with the crispy shrimp with bean blend! It's too die for! Every time I come in, they remember me and knows exactly what I want! Five stars for me!"
Yuan Mei Asian noodle Chinese style,5,"Best Chinese food ever! this is a family owned place, definitely a good little business to support. Try the crab rangoons."
NoJa,5,"I have been to NoJa several times. This restaurant's ambience is charming. It has a semi open kitchen as you walk into the front. It feels like a warehouse meets a romantic Paris cafe. The wait staff is very much in touch with the menu. The waiter and waitress here are the best of the best. They are attentive and helpful. I can honestly say I have never had meal that was not perfect. The mashed potato are the best and it I is not fair to call them mashed potatoes. The salads are delicious and their homemade dressings are so light, the salads are never are overdressed. They have a fantastic wine list and their specialty drinks are the bomb. The Old fashions, French 75's, and a fresh pear drink that was delicious. I highly recommend the duck. Their steaks and their specials are delicious too. I have had a steak in the past and the fish (which was a special of the night) were both tastyI fine it difficult not to order the duck. Each time I have had the duck, it was outstanding and the best I have had outside of France. My last trip I ordered the duck, and I must say it was perfect. This is a sweet romantic restaurant for a special occasion. If you are visiting Mobile or if you live in the area I totally suggest dying at this delicious restaurant as it is a true gem!!!"
NoJa,5,"I (literally) don't know what's taken me so long to dine here, but I'm so glad Open Table (and my search for the hubby's birthday dinner reservation) prompted me to pull the trigger! From the moment we arrived to the time we left, we were impressed. Promptly seated, cocktails were spot on, bread service was nice (love the -- tomato w/ a perfect hint of honey-- butter), and the apps were divine. The hubs' pork belly was a real star! My shrimp bisque was great also. Paulina was an awesome server and gave great recommendations. For our entrees, I went with the salmon and hubs got the Kansas City Strip. BOTH were amazing. Temperatures were perfect, the flavors were poppin', and Kevin (on proteins) deserves a friggin' medal! I have NEVER had the perfect crisp on salmon that I had tonight! (Never. My eyes watered a little!) We were too stuffed for dessert, but trust me-- we'll be back! This dinner was one for the books! SALUD!"
NoJa,5,I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews. It's the best restaurant I ate at while I was in Mobile for work. The shrimp and grits here are out of this world- They get their shrimps fresh from the gulf coast nearby. The outdoor patio is soooo cute and a perfect place for a date!
NoJa,4,"Ate here about a week ago with some friends. I've been wanting to try this place out because I heard so many good reviews. The atmosphere is a bit classy but very relaxing. We had a 2 year old with us, but luckily she was well behaved and the staff was very sweet to her. We didn't have to wait to be seated. Our waiter was very attentive and nice. We got to enjoy the Foie gras, crab fritters, lamb chop plate, duck plate and the panko crusted bass. All was cooked very well, medium. The lamb needed more seasoning but was still fantastic to eat. The noja potatoes are a must as a side. It is very different side combo. It kinda looks like grits but are fantastic."
NoJa,5,"Probably the best restaurant I've ever ate at in Mobile Alabama, the food is so delicious and rich in flavor. Date night favorite for my wife and I. The steaks are the best."
NoJa,5,"NoJa is in downtown Mobile on Jackson St. Just go. Everything single thing we had was wonderful, from start to finish. NoJa is small, with only about a dozen tables so make a reservation. If you wait until it's a bit cooler you might want to dine in their beautiful little courtyard in the back. Warm and comfortable with a brick and history motif, it has an open kitchen where I think they literally make magic. The bread and tomato-herb infused butter was a great start. We shared the sous vide pork belly, and crab fritters, which were both just incredible. Shrimp bisque was on point. The Ethiopian Chicken, Duck with aged balsamic cherry reduction, Panko Cobia with ginger-miso sauce, down to every single vegetable, was excellent. They take this restaurant very seriously. I am just so impressed!"
NoJa,5,Noja did not disappoint.   The crab fritter was so crispy  on the outside and luscious on the inside.  The chicken Ethiopia took us straight to the Country.  The special lambchops were sumptuous.
NoJa,5,This gives Osman's a run for its money as best fine dining spot in Mobile- it's between those 2 for sure. We had the dark meat chicken (thigh) appetizer which I highly recommend. I had the Panko crusted fish (forgot the species but it was deep water and flakey) with NoJa mashed potatoes & Brussels sprouts. My wife had the filet mignon with the potatoes and the zucchini noodles. Both entrees were great. The dessert was very ok (donut with ice cream) but there were others on the menu that seemed like they'd be great.Great specialty drinks as well - I had the 6 N Jackson. Place has a great ambiance and is one of my favorites in Mobile!
NoJa,4,"We landed here for dinner the other night. While it isn't a very kid friendly restaurant, my 2yo was with us (we had dinner plans elsewhere that fell through) and staff were very accommodating and thank god she was pretty well behaved because I feared we would disrupt other diners. Food was great, but definitely more of a special occasion place. We ordered the fois gras and crab fritters for appetizers. Both were delicious but the fois gras was beyond amazing. I just wish there was more! Lol. Entrees we ordered the duck, lamb chops, and panko crusted bass. Everything was cooked perfectly. The meats were done a perfect medium and the fish was crisp with a flaky inside. The sides were delicious too. The noja potatoes are a must. The only complaint was that the lamb chops could have been seasoned a bit better. They were cooked nicely, but the meat was bit bland. Other than that, our dining experience was great and would definitely recommend this place for a date night or special dinner."
NoJa,5,Jennifer was our server.  She wasExcellent!  I had bone in ribeye.  Cooked perfectly and was very tender.  Had the duck liver.  Very tasty!  Salad was delicious just needed more.  Highly recommend eating here.
NoJa,5,"Excellent food !! Had a large business dinner, plates and appetizers shared from a number of items.Normally am quite sckeptical of any place claiming ""fusion"" NoJa lists a southern Mediterranean fusion and the chef is of Ethiopian decent so was not sure what to expect . There are many ways that mix could go wrong but NoJa has it exactly right Starters were amazing, had the foiegras, pork cheeks, and shrimp-scallops, all extremely well.done and paired well to set the pallet for the mainsDuck over grits wity cherry basalmic reduction and kale was fantastic. Others had the pecan cruster grouper special and loved it. Had a table side order of brussel sprouts which also amazingHome ginger doughnut and ice desert was really amazingDining area was comfortable and not cramped despite being a small venue, nice round table for large group which is very social Service staff was excellent !! Very knowledgeable on the menu but best of all not pretentiousOverall a very high quality dining experience yet retains a southern charm and comfort I forcast James Beard awards NoJa's future if they were in a larger market like New Orleans unquestionably would of had one by now"
NoJa,5,We have been to NoJa a few times over the years and it is always amazing.  Delicious food and some of the best service.  Highly recommend the salmon and Ethiopian chicken.
NoJa,5,"The best restaurant in Mobile! I always get the steak, and it's always perfect. The makes potatoes are ridiculously good. Their desserts are amazing. Their wune list can't be beat."
NoJa,5,"Wow what a great atmosphere, excellent wine menu and appetizers. The house salad was unique and the fish special was outstanding.Don't skip the ginger donut with the special popcorn ice cream. The ice cream is sourced locally from the peanut shop next door."
NoJa,5,"Delicious!  Great blend of Greek flavor with a kick of spice!  The poster says ""once you have it, you love it!"" And I couldn't agree more. Very friendly service and great food makes for a great experience."
NoJa,5,"The most enjoyable fine dining meal I've had in Mobile. Creative, cuisine (refreshingly different from standard gulf coast food) combined with the perfect atmosphere (lively feel without being noisy is my preference over very quiet low ceiling places) will have us coming back.  Steaks so tender no steak knives are needed.  Friendly owner, management and staff."
NoJa,4,"I was so excited to try this place because I've heard so many great things about it! I made reservations as suggested for my party of four. My cousin and his fiancé were home from Texas so this was the perfect opportunity to give it a shot! The ambiance is nice and we were seated immediately. We had a nice view of the kitchen which I love because I adore the culinary arts. Our waitress Nicole was very sweet and knowledgeable. She gave great suggestions on what to order. We arrived at 8:31; one minute after our reservation. We ordered drinks and appetizers. Shortly thereafter we ordered our entrees. We all begin to notice that the wait for our food was becoming longer and longer. I then noticed a table seated after us was plated before us. Since it has been well over 30 minutes since we ordered, I got up to inquire about why our food was taking so long. (At this point its 9:40; remember our 8:31 arrival?) I was told that because we ordered the stuffed pork chops it took 45 minutes to cook them. The couple who was seated after us ordered the salmon and that cooks faster. Now let me say the food was good. I had to add a little salt to my chop but the food was tasty. Everyone enjoyed their meals once they finally came. After my inquiry on the wait; It would have been nice to have a visit from the manager to our table just to assure us that the chefs were diligently working on our meals. It also would have been nice to be pre-warned that the dish we ordered takes 45 minutes to cook. Maybe had we known we would have selected another item on the menu. I've been to establishments who do that so I know this is not foreign to the industry. Overall I'm giving it 4 stars because of the prolonged wait. But I must say I will visit them again in the future."
NoJa,4,"Went for a corporate dinner and I found the place acceptable.  We had been eating much of the day at a corporate event so I wasn't starving, but I would consider the overall plates small.  I ordered one of the specials which was scallops with a type of green mixed in on a purée of something.  Sorry I forgot what the waitress said.  All in all the portion was perfect for what I wanted.  I wasn't overstuffed after eating it and it was tasty.  Excellent food wine selection as well.  If you are staying ok downtown Mobile this place is walking distance to the hotels in the general area.  I would probably visit again."
NoJa,5,Yum!Yum!Foie gras with bacon jam.Iceberg with buttermilk dressing.Pasta with mushrooms and mascarpone and tomato sauce.Chocolate donut with caramel popcorn ice cream.Oh . . . and wine by the glass that only comes by the bottle on the west coast. (Rombauer and Caymus)Did I say ?
NoJa,5,"This is our favorite restaurant! We've been coming here for years, they have us so spoiled! The food is always awesome and the staff is not only professional but friendly!! We were there for dinner last night and I had the most luscious bone in filet mignon that I've had in a long time! My husband had flowers delivered for my birthday and staff came in early to accept delivery as the florist closes at noon!! The restaurant has great ambiance and wonderful courtyard dining. If you didn't know different you'd think you were dining in New Orleans!"
Blind Mule,5,"Stopped by after a friend recommended after having a few beers downtown. This place isn't much to look at on the inside or the outside for that matter, but the food is awesome. Great bar/pub food downtown. However the shrimp and grits will give and seafood spot in mobile or the causeway a run for its money! They are voted one of the best ""things to  eat before you die."" And have been festered on food network. The buyer gets are awesome one also. If you are downtown and it's a late night out, stop in!"
Blind Mule,5,"Would have never ever walked in this joint without a recommendation but I'm so glad we did! The outside is not inviting and even the inside made me think this is a bad idea. Creepy paintings on the walls for sale by local artists. But, friends of ours told us to not to be scared and to get the Shrimp and Grits because it was on a list on al.com (in the year 2012) of ""100 dishes to Eat in Alabama Before You Die"" and I have to admit, that SHOULD STILL be on the list. It was SO delicious! The grits were perfection, the sauce was a teensy weensy bit spicy, the shrimp were plentiful, and the conecuh sausage made it all come together. Aforementioned friends also recommended the Chili-cheese burger and it too was phenomenal. We will definitely be back! Apparently they serve a brunch that I gotta try...(insert smiling face licking lips emoji) Regrettably, my pictures didn't turn out right...it was dark...but trust me when I say, it looked amazing!"
Blind Mule,5,Dropped in to check this place out with my husband. It was a Sunday early evening. It wasn't crowded at all and I did smell food cooking sooo.I was kinda iffy. You know wondering if this place was going to be like the food in the photos? So we ordered the chili cheese fries. If it wasn't good? Then really...you haven't dropped a bunch of money on something you didn't like. I was very surprised when this came out. Lesson learned!!This place has lived up to its reputation. Great food and service. Keep it up guys! It may be just a hole in the wall...but don't let that fo you.
Blind Mule,4,"Cool place, we reserved a patio table for brunch, it was ready when we got there.  I love that people can bring their pets.   We really enjoyed the stuffed beignets and the mimosas.  I loved my crawfish Benny while my companions had the chicken and pancakes.  Over all we really like this place, food is great, not too expensive and the atmosphere is good too."
Blind Mule,5,Lunch with my daughter and she picked.  The servers were delightful and spot on with the recommendations.  My grilled Mahi was excellent and delivered to our table by the Chef.  My daughter got a salad--it was pretty but it was just a salad and she loved it.  A wonderful lunch before some shopping.
Blind Mule,4,This was a meal I shared with my in-laws and was surprisingly satisfying for our 7 member party. The shrimp & grits and chorizo breakfast burrito were a hit. I recommend the beer flight. The chocolate stout and yellowhammer octoberfest was my personal favs. My wife was too full to try the beignets. Maybe next time :)
Blind Mule,5,"This place was such a good find! The outside does not reflect how cute it is inside and how good the food is! I wish I had snapped some pics! We got the grilled and filled mahi  and the red beans and rice. The food was so so delicious and our server was really kind and hospitable. She even brought our little dog a water bowl. The outside seating is really cute, private and casual. They have a huge selection of beers. A huge thank you for making us feel so welcome and filling our Belly's with such good food!"
Blind Mule,5,"Never disappoints!! Hands down one of the best spots in Mobile for brunch, lunch, dinner, or just for drinks. Try anything.. it's all delicious."
Blind Mule,5,"I love finding eclectic pubs and eateries, especially since I go to Ireland often. When I see a pub, it has to have its on story. Which is why I high key hate Irish pubs in America, they are all generic and don't know what they wanna be or do. For such a little gastropub that sits on the outskirts of downtown, it has so much life. The local art, the little quirks that make it unique, the music, the courtyard. Everything. Is. Fabulous. The drinks and the food are, of course, a large part, but my god. You need to eat everything at least once. I have tried basically everything, and I don't think there's anything that I don't like. It's all so wonderful! Although I'm just now starting drinking beer there's a lot of domestics, drafts, and ipas, and I'm sure they're great. The cocktails tho, they're fabulous. All in all the place is wonderful and we WILL be coming back. PS: My Mexican wife said the breakfast burrito was probably the most authentic huevos con chorizo burrito from any restaurant in America. She literally said, ""That looks and smells like a burrito my mom would make."" So if I could give extra stars, I would!"
Blind Mule,4,"The establishment is super chill, I enjoyed the ambiance. Came here for brunch with some friends visiting town. Overall thoughts.Service: 5/5. The waiter was awesome and hilarious and definitely made the meal greatFood: 4/5. I thought the burger was amazing, the shrimp and grits were yummy but the rice and beans were just ok. Portion size was just ok for the rice and beans, but maybe we were just extra hungry. Prices were a bit on the steeper side for MobileI definitely would return, they have some lovely craft beers. I wanted to try the crawfish entree for brunch but I guess they only do it on the weekends. Will have to return!"
Blind Mule,5,Absolutely hands down the best shrimp and grits ever created. Best brunch place in Mobile. Awesome music venue upstairs on the weekends. Amazingly cool staff.
Blind Mule,3,"Came here on a Friday afternoon & had a bowl ofseafood gumbo, which I thought was delicious. I had two drinks, a stiff jack and coke & a can of something orange juice flavored called a "" boy"". Small restraunt, outdoor seating is available, full bar, and a small but satisfying menu. I almost got one of thier burgers from the kitchen, but I did not want a large meal. There were several people sitting at tables eating quietly on thier lunch break from work, but I chose to sit at the bar to order, eat my food, and have drinks. A few people came in and got some salads to go from the kitchen and went on thier way back to work. I noticed that there were stairs leading upstairs and I asked the bartenders about it, they told me that sometimes they have live music at night upstairs. I liked my food, my drinks were good, but I felt the bartenders/ wait staff were more interested in talking amoungst one another and not to me or any other customers, so I left. They seemed to keep busy, cutting up limes, counting thier tills, stocking thier bars, but I felt unwelcome, so I left. Its too bad because this seems like a neat place, its off the beaten path not on Dauphin street, so you kind of got to look for it."
Blind Mule,1,"Went for brunch, chicken and pancakes were over priced. spent $12 for one pancake and two chicken tenders. a breakfast burrito was much cheaper so I had figured I would get more. Waiter was wearing a shirt saying "" everything I learned about sex I learned from the boy scouts"", offensive and horrible.   Asked for ranch and did not received. Coupled with high wait times and poor sercice. Took out party 25 minutes to get checks. Would not reccommend."
Blind Mule,4,"I love going to local dives, as they tend to have food with heart.  This place does not disappoint.  The outside leads you to believe it is from a forgotten past, but the dive comes alive when you walk in the door.  The food fits the bill as well.  For my first time here, I enjoyed a cup of the chili and a grilled shrimp POboy. Both were excellent and a good sign of better things to come(on my next visit. Katie was the waitress today.  She was happy and polite.  On top of her game and very helpful.   Great choice.   4 stars to give em something to work toward.  Not sure they need to improve though!!  Enjoy!"
Blind Mule,5,"They have the dopest brunch in town for several reasons. One, the food is quirky and tasty. Two, bottomless mimosas. Three, a courtyard. Know this. You will be napping in the afternoon."
Blind Mule,5,"Super homey place. We love the courtyard. & it's the perfect way to enjoy a Sunday brunch!!! You can't beat the ""blind mule Bake"". My hubby loves the  The servers are superb. Efficient, friendly and caring. Becca has been there a while. & we love her. The owner, Ed is terrific & even a great cook. Fun place to hang out."
Blind Mule,5,"So... to be honest... I almost skipped out on coming here. From the outside it looks a little sketchy, however the food was great. I had a wrap and my friend got a burger. Everything was cooked perfectly and our server was super sweet. Will definitely be back. Big bonus.... free parking!"
Blind Mule,5,The Food and service was great! Lex was a great server and very helpful. The salad was as happy as a salad could be! The buffalo chicken wrap and fried veggies were amazing! Get some extra house made ranch to dip in! And the fried mushrooms were so Good! Great courtyard set up and dog friendly plus cute bathroom signs!
Blind Mule,5,Been here twice for Sunday brunch and will definitely be back again! First time I got crawfish bennys and the second time I got chicken & pancakes! Cool atmosphere and good service!
Blind Mule,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed my blackened chicken sandwich. Tried to be good and order the grilled veg as a side, but as they were out of it for the day, I also thoroughly enjoyed my sweet potato waffle fries (obviously).Nice, unpretentious bar with a strong community vibe, featuring trivia nights, open mics, and more..."
Mediterranean Sandwich,5,Stopped by Mobile and we are so glad we stopped here!! Got the Chicken Funghi and lentil soup. It was good!! Oh and got a free brownie baklava for a mini-incident I caused... customer service 5 star!!! Good food good people good weather... what more can a girl want... right! My friend got lamb gryo with a side of pasta and bacon. Plain good.
Mediterranean Sandwich,4,"The food was good.  I stopped in for dinner while visiting Mobile.  This is a nice spot on Dauphin Street that was near my hotel.  I asked for a combination plate but they were able to put together a very delicious chicken and rice bowl that I enjoyed.  I recommend them for a nice, quick dinner or lunch along the main drag in Mobile.  They were very accommodating and very nice."
Mediterranean Sandwich,4,"Great hole in the spot for lunch. A wide selection of sandwiches and apps. I got the Greek salad and hummus, and it was solid. The hummus is really herby and the pita is nicely toasted and seasoned. The Greek salad is fine - though some of the romaine was pink/brown around the edges. My dining companions got the Red Rooster sandwich and said it was great. I wish they had more vegetarian entree options, like falafel, but it's a very meat heavy menu. Staff is very nice and efficient. Not a ton of seating inside but they do have a few high tops. Probably better for take out. Will be back here for lunch in the future for sure."
Mediterranean Sandwich,4,"Fantastic spot in Mobile for great food and fast friendly professional service. Instant hit for me and will be back as I am in town to try some other offerings. I had the ""Red Rooster"" - a combination of Chicken, Conecuh sausage, peppers and onions, smoked Gouda cheese mozzarella and something secret and magical called ""Rooster Sauce"" - and it WORKED. Along with that was the Bacon Carbonara Orzo Pasta - which I could have eaten a bowl of easily. Finished off with the Baklava - of course - and it was the expected pile of sticky, flaky goodness. This is a great spot and checks a lot of boxes - location, quality of food, high level of service, very reasonably priced. Will definitely explore more of this menu......!!"
Mediterranean Sandwich,5,Always good food. Anytime I'm in Mobile I look to come here at some point. The food is consistent and some the specialty wraps are the best choice
Mediterranean Sandwich,5,"Atmosphere: Mediterranean Sandwich Company's downtown location is a bit on the older side, but given that this is its original location (in the heart of downtown Mobile), I think it adds some charm to the place. Seating is a bit limited inside, but this is also a great place to take your food to-go.Service: I've never had a problem with service here. Staff is always very friendly, and food comes out pretty quickly. You order at the cash register, and your food is brought out to your table.Food: This time around, we ordered the Chicken Funghi and Redneck Gyro combos with the bacon carbonara orzo pasta as our sides. The orzo is to die for!! It has an amazing flavor and is super addicting. The chicken funghi is delicious--the chicken and mushrooms are juicy, and the pesto mayonnaise goes well with the panini. The Redneck Gyro was one of the best gyros we've ever had. The problem with some beef-lamb gyros is that it tastes kind of like a breakfast sausage. This gyro does not disappoint at all. The meat was super flavorful and paired well with the accompanying veggies, sauce, and pita. Overall: I've been to Mediterranean Sandwich Company many times over the past 5 years, and they never fail to impress me. I always finish my food satisfied, and this is always my first recommendation to visitors and tourists when they ask for places to eat in Mobile. Consistency with the bacon carbonara orzo might be the only very minor downside to Mediterranean Sandwich Company. But this problem comes down to ""is the bacon carbonara orzo just good today or REALLY good today?"" Nonetheless, if you are in the area, definitely come and eat at Mediterranean Sandwich Company."
Mediterranean Sandwich,4,"A small popular lunch spot for downtown workers.  Inside seating is limited but there are several tables outside on the sidewalk.  They have a large menu and many of the items were quite interesting.  You order and pay at the back counter, pick up your drinks and then they bring the food to your table.  I ordered the Greek Salad with chicken.  It was a large salad offered with dressing on the side and pita bread.  I don't use much dressing and didn't care much for the dressing.  I'm sure I could have gotten a different dressing but didn't . We also tried the mixed grill sandwich which was very tasty.  They do not offer beer or wine."
Mediterranean Sandwich,4,"If you flavor off the beaten path, you have come to the right place. Not your burger and fry or generic make my sandwich kinda place. Food is excellent and the flavors will wake up your taste buds.  Small intimate locale, but gotta love the character.  Staff is always pleasant and service excellent. Only 4 stars, cause hey, gotta leave room to make em wanna keep fighting harder!!  Come in and enjoy!"
Mediterranean Sandwich,5,It was awesome! My goat cheese salad was soooooo good!  I will definitely  come back again!
Mediterranean Sandwich,5,"Walked by this place and loved the smell coming from it. Had the redneck gyro, it was the best gyro I ever had. The conecuh sausage was fabulous. First time eating it. The tzatziki sauce with the seasonings was great. Next time.in Mobile I will definitely stop. The 2 girls that were working were pleasant, friendly, courteous and informative."
Mediterranean Sandwich,4,"Really good! Had a panini sandwich it was tasty. Came w carbonara style orzo salad that was also pretty good, but heavy. Place was hopping at lunch time, but service was fast and friendly."
Mediterranean Sandwich,5,Most underrated restaurant in town. They've never let me down. The panini's are awesome and the orzo and rice are delicious too!
Mediterranean Sandwich,3,Decided on this restaurant based of Yelp reviews. We were looking for a change of cuisine after eating nothing but American food on the cruise. Super small restaurant. It is dingy looking to me. Needs a fresh coat of paint. Posters hanging on the wall with scotch tape. Lots of awards. Lots of locals flooded in for lunch starting at 11. They placed their orders and took off. Locals don't seem to dine in. Ordered hummus and extra feta and pita breasas an appetizer. The hummus was a little too oily and gritty to me. It didn't taste much like hummus. No extra feta to be found. The pita bread looked like pizza crust. I'm almost positive it was thin crust pizza that was used. Ordered chicken shwarma gyro. The pita bread was warm and toasted. Chicken wasn't moist. The side of bacon orzo was ok. It was better than the hummus. I didn't finish any of my food because it wasn't good enough to finish. I wouldn't say this place is authentic but it will do. Everyone raves about this place. If I return to Mobile I might return here and try something else. I wouldn't recommend as a first pick.
Mediterranean Sandwich,5,So glad we found this gem not far off I-10. The menu is full of amazing options. Food was fast even during lunch hour. Every item we tried was bursting with flavor. Even our picky eater kiddos loved their meal. We will definitely be stopping by on our next trip through Mobile.
Mediterranean Sandwich,5,"""Usually they don't put in that much goat cheese"". My panini was good but the goat cheese salad with chicken added was huge and delicious. This place would be popular if it was actually in Israel or elsewhere in a Mediterranean country. Definitely southern flair but wow, it exceeded expectations. And the ambiance is perfect. Sat outside under the shady umbrella. Great food, great price. 5 stars for sure."
Mediterranean Sandwich,4,One of the best lunch spots (and late-night) in the downtown area. Very reasonable prices and a lot of love put into the food.
Mediterranean Sandwich,5,"Friendly staff, delicious food and excellent prices! The spinach & tomato orzo is one of my favorites here!"
Mediterranean Sandwich,5,First time here and it was worth it! My family and I came down to see a concert and we seen the high rating on Yelp and decided to try it out.
Mediterranean Sandwich,4,"We were driving through and were in need of some yummy lunch. Since this place had such good reviews - we had to check it out. I saw Gabriel's review on it not being hard to eat here being vegan. I'm not 100% vegan, but try to eat at least 85%, especially when I eat out. We found parking a few streets away in a free lot. There is probably closer parking, but we aren't familiar with this area so we parked where we could. The people working were nice and helpful with suggesting what to order.I had the Falafel burger and it was good. My husband got the Moroccan chicken and he liked it too. I'm not positive if I would order the Falafel again, not because I didn't like it, but I just would like to try something else."
Mediterranean Sandwich,5,This place rocks. A veritable flavor explosion in every tasty morsel!!  We had the chicken fungi and I totally understand why this place won every foodie award possible. Skip the greasy fried food place across the street and get true flavor.
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,"Visited here for a work day lunch and really enjoyed it. The facility itself is very nice. Staff was friendly.I had The Squawking Goat, described on the menu as Flaky biscuit, all-natural fried chicken breast, fried goat cheese medallion and house-made pepper jelly. the flavor profile was DELICIOUS. The crispy salty of the chicken with the goat cheese medallion and the slightly sweet jelly drizzle (more like a hearty pour!) went well together. It was about 7 inches tall.I was concerned that my $9 biscuit didn't come with a single side. And the biscuit wasn't ""flaky"" at all. BUT, the food quantity was perfect for lunch and the flavor was great. My lunch companions tried The Five (gravy looked delicious!) and Sunshine in the Garden bowl. Both looked phenomenal. I might try that bowl on the next trip."
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,1,"High hopes were met with very low delivery. They were out of goat cheese so there went my chance to get the dish everyone raves about. What I got was overpriced, under flavored ""soul food"" without a shred of soul. Biscuit and gravy should be the easiest southern dish on earth to prepare. It shouldn't be a boring mush of too much salt and too little flavor yet here we are, remembering just that - sadness, if it had a flavor, would be a bad plate of biscuits and gravy. Service was equally underwhelming. Some diners were brought their food, the rest of us were not. It wasn't a full house so I'm not sure what the excuse would be. Won't go back. Especially when we have local restaurants that deliver far superior food and I don't leave feeling ripped off. Maybe whatever opens there next will deliver, because I don't see this place lasting very long."
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,"I thought this was a cute little spot. I'll definitely bring my mother here on her next visit to Mobile.The day I went just happened to be an extra beautiful day so we sat outside and enjoyed a delicious goat cheese, chicken biscuit (The squawking goat) I recommend getting the pepper jelly on the side because it is super sweet and overwhelming. I only ended up using a little bit of what they gave me. I was forewarned, when my friend told me it would be sitting in a pool of pepper jelly. The biscuit was great! I also ordered a regular latte. However, I received a super sweet sugary latte which I wasn't really into but drink anyway. Other than that everything was great though. I'll definitely be back to try out some more delicious things."
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,"So finally after 3 visits, I can say ""Maple Street Biscuit was amazing"" Great food, great vibe, furbaby friendly patio and oh yeah, great service.Each month, instead of giving your name when you place your order, you answer the monthly question. This months  question ""What's your favorite band"".I like the layout but the door area near the cashier will get a little congested with walk-ins and it's the line for placing orders, so grab a menu, if needed, a head to the back of the line. Service was very steady and the line moved within a few minutes.At the register, you place your order, and pickup around the corner when they call the name of your band - Like hmm, let's just say, I don't know, New Edition. So when you hear ""New Edition""  you head to the pick up area. There is no table service, just wait to hear your band. If your ordered a latte, it's the same process. Both times, I ordered, the drink station was very slow. No worries, shake it off and let's eat.The first time I visited was grand opening day and I got a Squawking Goat togo. I was underwhelmed at the presentation in a Togo box. Everything was there but the Goat cheese. I know what you're thinking, maybe it was a tiny piece baked into the biscuit, nope it was not.  I was missing the goat cheese and in my Togo box was a Biscuit, chicken, and a small container of pepper jelly. Really! No goat cheese, I mean really, no Goat. The second time they were sold out. The manager was very apologetic and offered me a gift card to try it again.So here we go. It was delicious. I am so. Glad I decided to eat in because the presentation was incredible. Now the chicken biscuit with pepper jelly from the 1st time was still very good. But the Squawking Goat was incredible. My guest had the Five and Dime (see pic) and they were very, very pleased. I mean what's not to like, it's the South, and anything smothered in gravy, sausage gravy, is Good. Welcome Maple Street Biscuits. We look forward to seeing you again soon."
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,"""IT'S BRAND SPANKIN' NEW!"" As a Floridian, I've been in love with Maple Street for years! I've visited several locations across Florida and on South Georgia. Tonight, while attending the soft opening, I was pleased to see that Laura and her team are serving the same great flavor, consistency, and quality here in Mobile! The systems are in place and the minor kinks are being ironed out. There's plenty of space and parking. The building and branding is beautiful, and WeMo just got a gem! The breakfast/brunch game just leveled up, and I'm truly excited about MSBC being my new, favorite neighborhood breakfast option! PERSONAL FAVES: -Fresh OJ-Maple Coffee -Retro biscuit (not on the menu) but a classic -- sausage, egg, and cheese w/ their yummy sausage gravy on the side! (That's my jam y'all!)-Mashups (they have a new name, but same awesomeness!)-Iced cinnamon biscuits (when served warm!)Gah, I just love it-- Welcome to Mobile!"
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,"I love all things breakfast, and Maple Street is just what we needed in this area! My husband and I went opening week, and although it was busy, they were super quick. The establishment itself was super cute, with both indoor and outdoor seating. I saw some people with their dogs outside, so I assume they are pet friendly!  With bar height, two seat and 4+ seater tables, you're sure to find seating that fits your needs. The order process was straight forward, with a walk up and order setting. They ask you your favorite band before you sit down, and that's how they call your order out when it's ready, so that was fun! (Especially when I got the deer in the headlights look and my hubby blurted out Selena )Now as for the food, it was scrumptious! We got the biscuits and gravy, the fried green tomatoes and The Five. The biscuits were heavenly, both flaky and soft; and the gravy had just the right amount of sausage and pepper in it to give it a little kick. The fried green tomatoes were lightly breaded, and although a little thickly sliced, tasted delish. And the five, according to my husband was amazing. From the bacon, to the chicken atop the biscuit, every ingredient was fresh and full of flavor. Also, the coffee is amazing. I could easily just go for a biscuit and coffee on a relaxing morning.All of the staff was friendly and on top of it. We were asked several times if we needed anything else and if we enjoyed our meals, and we certainly did. This is a must return place and definitely somewhere we'd bring family from out of town! Can't wait to go back"
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,4,So glad we decided to come early (7:25am) this month you give them the name of your favorite band when you order and that's what they call out when your order is ready kind of cute- The place was packed by 8:30am with no spaces to park. Nice to see all of the fur babies on the front patio. I plan to bring mine when it cools off.Iced coffee was delicious.. maple  vanilla latte. The biscuits were delicious - so many items I want to try next time - Happy they are here in Mobile!
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,"Coming in opening weekend I knew this place would be busy, so I'm not going to really say a whole lot about the wait to order or to get the food, it was slower than what they probably will be at some point BUT the staff was working their butts off to keep things flowing.There is inside and outside seating, the inside is a cute atmosphere and has some large tables that can easily hold 6-8 people. You seat yourself though, so whether the larger tables are available during your visit is up to chance. The iced maple vanilla bean latte is delicious! If you hang around the front counter you can watch as it's made, including the shot of maple syrup! There is also fresh squeezed orange juice, perfect to pair with all of the breakfast items on the menu. The biscuits are AMAZING. Definitely lived up to my expectations. The Firebird is a buffalo sauced dream, and has quite the kick of spice. My fiancé ordered the Five, which was tasty, the gravy was creamy and gave the biscuit the perfect flavor. The fried chicken on each biscuit was yum!The menu isn't huge but still offers enough to please almost everyone. The waffles were a huge hit among the little ones.Oh, and the best part? They call your order based on your favorite band. So if you like Queen, they'll say ""ORDER FOR QUEEN"" when it's your turn to grab your goodies. Definitely a fun touch! Can't wait to go back and try more."
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,4,The food was everything I imagined it to be. I am so glad I was able to try this place out with my mother. We love brunch and all the carbs! I would give the foot a 5 star rating. It was a slow experience so do not be in a hurry when coming here. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I definitely will come back.
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,Oh my goodness this place is outstanding. I wish I'd have taken pictures of my order but it looked so tasty that I immediately dug in. I was not disappointed. I got the hash brown cake and the five. The chicken was juicy and tasted fresh. I got the gravy in the side because I was worried about the kick but it was super good. I put gravy on my hash brown cake too. My daughter got the bam yo yo. It was huge. She ended up sharing it. It was also really delicious and the fresh maple syrup was perfect! My son got the sticky maple and devoured it. The portions are large and worth every penny. I truly enjoyed the atmosphere as well.
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,4,"5 star flavor but it comes at a price. We ordered the Squawking Goat which is a biscuit with fried chicken and fries goat cheese smothered in pepper jelly. I had the Five and Dime which is a biscuit with fried chicken, bacon, fried egg, and a spicy sausage gravy. We both loved our biscuits! The sausage gravy was spicier than I expected but a welcomed treat. It was spicier than the pepper jelly on the other biscuit. The 2 biscuits and one coffee. Was 23.93. . So this the reason for the 4 star. Flavors are great and a very cool atmosphere but wowzer on the wallet. Tip: they ask you a personalized silly question at the end of your order...to identify it as your order. Our question was if you could be any monster what would your monsters name be. Then they call your answer when your order is ready."
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,Me and my husband have been wanting to give this place a try.Well we are so glad we did and cannot wait to go back. I had The Club and he had The Five & Dime and we shared a Groovy Gravy O'Ryan. Everything was great and we cannot wait to bring our son back. Best chicken biscuit I have ever had!
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,"My husband and I saw this place being built for a while. We wondered what had happened when construction mysteriously stopped for a while. When it resumed, we eagerly looked forward to the restaurant (hopefully) soon to come. We were not disappointed!This place has been so crowded every other time we've driven by it that we never thought we were going to be able to get in to eat. But today was our day. We were a little put off by the lack of table service, but the food more than made up for it!I got the Squawking Goat with goat cheese and pepper jelly on the side. The biscuit must have maple in it because it had a subtle maple flavor. The chicken breast was nicely fried and very tender and juicy. The pepper jelly (made in house) had a lovely piquant flavor without being too spicy and it complimented the rich and creamy goat cheese well. My food was delicious. My husband got the Potatoes O'Ryan. He loved them. His favorite thing about them was the shiitake mushroom gravy. It had a little bit of a spicy kick to it, but not overwhelmingly so. The potatoes were nicely golden browned and the cheese very good. We shared an order of fried green tomatoes. They were all right, but nothing exceptional. A nice remoulade sauce would elevate them, rather than the ranch dressing they were served with. Still, they were good and a nice portion.I also had a fresh squeezed orange juice mimosa. It was wonderful!  They didn't skimp on the champagne and the fresh squeezed orange juice was fantastic!  We also got coffee and their selection of coffees seemed very nice. I got the Dark Bark (a nice, full body dark roast) and my husband got the Maple which he enjoyed. I do wish they had non-dairy creamer options, though. We will definitely return and hopefully bring some friends!"
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,"This will definitely become a breakfast hangout.Great food and inviting atmosphere.  You order your food for sitting in or takeout.  I sat inside.  Instead of calling out numbers this month they ask you for your favorite monster. ‍ I couldn't think of anything but ""King Kong""  I ordered the Bam  waffle and coffee.  Everything was delicious.  The orange  juice is freshly made (for real).  Thumbs up  I will be back soon."
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,Atmosphere first. Comfortable yet industrial. Well lit. Clean. The outdoor area is perfect and highlights the muffler shop that first occupied this space. Service was kind and friendly. They asked what you would name your Thanksgiving Turkey to give your order a name. Clever. Best overall attraction: a fresh squeezed orange juice machine that automatically turns ugly oranges into delicious juice. Get some.I had the famous biscuit. It was good. Everything has chicken on it....Our group of four loved everything. Can't go wrong with your order here. Bring some friends and enjoy.
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,"Visited this location for the first time last Friday about an hour after opening and there was no line... I thought I'd hit the jackpot!  I ordered my food and found a seat and it took roughly 25 minutes for my food to come. Considering the low traffic, I thought this was a bit too long of a wait... not to mention, my food (albeit delicious) was served lukewarm at best.  I still feel that my experience was a 5-star experience because the food was delicious, the staff was super nice and friendly, and the restaurant was clean and orderly!  I ordered The Farmer (chicken biscuit with pecan wood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, and TONS of delicious house-made apple butter), Sweet Grace (chocolate chip waffle topped with strawberries, whipped cream, powdered sugar, and a side of maple syrup), a side order of Cheese Grits (they add cream cheese which made them super creamy and delicious) and an Iced Cinnamon Biscuit.  All were AMAZING and well worth the money and calories! I'll definitely be going back to try other items on the menu."
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,5,"I visited Maple Street Biscuit Company for the first time about a week or two after their opening, and their lines are still out the door!  We arrived at 10:45, and it was not any shorter after we left around 12:30.  So, if you are planning on going anytime soon, expect a wait!  It took us about a 30 minutes to order, and it was another 30 minutes to get our food.  Once we got our food, though, it was absolutely delicious!  I got the Firebird; my wife got the Sunshine in the Garden Bowl; and we shared the Three Layer Cake.  The Firebird was the perfect amount of spice; the Sunshine in the Garden Bowl was very fresh and a wonderful combination of ingredients; and the Three Layer Cake was the perfect side item.  I loved their mushroom gravy. . .and everything else!Once a few more weeks pass, I'm sure they will work out the wait issues.  They seem to have a good system to get food out quickly, and I am sure Maple Street Biscuit Company will continue to be a Mobile favorite."
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,3,"It was ok. Not the best, but not the worst The meat and biscuit weren't hot or really even warm."
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,4,Great Addition to Mobile. Really enjoyed the Five and home fries. Look forward to returning and trying other it
Maple Street Biscuit Company - Mobile,4,"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now. When we first walked in, I noticed that there is a line where you make your order and then you choose where to sit. After you make your oder, they call your name when its ready. Fyi, They do not have trays to place multiple plates on. A cook assisted me in carrying my plates to my table. When my order was done, it was then when they told me they were out of grits. I had to get a refund on the grits. The food was really good. However, the food was not hot, but not ice cold either. It was room temperature. I wish it would have been hot. The prices are kind of high. I got a plain waffle for my 3 y/o and it was $9. They also charged full price (adult) for a kids drink. They charged me for the child's waffle that comes loaded with whipped cream and chocolate chips. Just a plain kids waffle, I believe, should be cheaper. For the 3 of us, the meal was right at $50.  With that said, I won't make several trips here. No complaints on the taste of the food, it was really good."
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"OMG! Osman's is sooo good y'all! From the bread service to the killer entrees, to the desserts, I thoroughly enjoyed it! The German schnitzel (my order) is gigantic and absolutely delicious, and the drinks are tasty also. During the Corona closures, they're still offering takeout and I'm definitely going to take them up on it! I've got to get my hands on their seafood tortellini, and soon."
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"In the middle of Covid, we wanted a nice restaurant meal. Osman's hit it out of the park.. Quick and easy ordering & the meal was delicious and generous. An entree with salad, roll an 2 side dishes was reasonably priced. We had blacked catch of the day & egg plan parmigiana, both were well received."
Osman’s Restaurant,4,"My second time here. First time was a few years ago. I got the jägerschnitzel. It came with a side salad, angel hair pasta, some veggies, and bread. Very delicious. The two massive pieces were crispy on the outside and tender in the inside. The creamy mushroom gravy for the schnitzel really completes the entire meal. And to overdo it, I got the mango cake too, which was ok.Would definitely recommend. Great food, big portions, and some authentic European fare, which I don't come across everyday."
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"I searched for something with local flavor and came across this place. They are a very small place with limited seating so reservations are a good idea. At first they didn't have a table, but after double checking they were able to seat me. (Traveling for work is not always fun, so when you find a one of a kind place with great food and great service, it is nice.). Mary was my waitress and was very accommodating. I had the Shrimp Gorgonzola and it was fabulous. The atmosphere is energetic as this is a house that was transformed into a cozy restaurant.  The chef cooks each individual dish to order, so expect a leisurely dining experience. I will most definitely be back on any future trips to Mobile. (But I will call ahead for a reservation!) Thank you Mary for an enjoyable dining experience!"
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"It will be soon for my return!  I can't wait to try the rest of their menu.We had the shrimp Gorgonzola as an appetizer with bread what a wonderful start and had us looking forward to the rest. I had the tortellini bake, delicious and not overly rich, full of tender shrimp.  The Gypsy style schnitzel was amazingly executed and the sauté on the top was so very flavorful . Dessert was a lemon curd cake not, a nice and moist sponge with that delicious bit of tartness that lemon brings.  could not have ended any better.For those of you that need to know I had a variety of Hefeweizen All of which I would gladly drink again.They are 20 years old and I can see why they have lasted wonderful service wonderful atmosphere and anyone that hasn't tried the restaurant needs to give it a go.  the dress is casual but not sloppy so keep that in mind"
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"A hidden gym in Mobile! Beautiful interior and wonderful service. We made a reservation, and even on a Tuesday night it was very busy, glad we did! I had the lamb chops, withe the sides of the night- angel hair pasta and green beans! The bread that comes before was delicious, the drink selection was great, I loved the many options for a good German beer! The four of us also split a dessert- it was huge! I highly recommend stopping here for dinner, we will be back!"
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"You wouldn't expect a fine dining restaurant hidden away on a sleepy side street off of Government boulevard, but Osman's is just that... a house converted into a restaurant where you'll find deliciously satisfying German, Italian and other European fare.  The place is closed on Sundays and Mondays, and dinner is served 5p - 9p Tues - Sat.  Reservations are very highly suggested, there is limited seating since the owner/chef makes the dishes himself in the kitchen, where you can literally hear him pounding flat your schnitzel, and he does not sacrifice quality for quantity.  While smaller groups are welcome, larger groups (10+) are often refused because he can only cook so many dishes at one time and they do not want to serve half a table while the other half waits.Osman's has an extensive wine list, and has many interesting bottles for sale.  The rear wall of the dining room is lined with wine racks.  The restaurant itself is intimate and cozy.  Many of the desserts are homemade.My go to dinner here is jaeger schnitzel, which is the regular wiener schnitzel (2 pieces lightly breaded and golden brown, each about the size of a car's hubcap... for real.. and stacked on top of each other they still overlap the sides of the dinner plate) covered with a rich mushroom and onion gravy.  Typically seasonal vegetables, roasted potatoes or red pepper flecked angel hair pasta is served on the side depending on what the chef is serving that day.There are a couple of really good appetizers I've tried as well... the gnocchi gorgonzola is amazing and the brie osman's is a round of brie breaded and fried with a dollop of jam on top served with crackers.Some other dishes friends I've dined with swear by are the brown butter filet and on occasion the chef will have prepared lasagna (served in individual size ramekins).  Osman's may not look like much from the outside... but once you step inside and take in the cozy interior and smell the old world scent flowing out of the kitchen, you'll be hooked."
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"This place has been consistently delicious over the years. We only make it here a few times a year and always choose it for our anniversary dinner. I've tried a lot on the menu with the the filet, Gorgonzola shrimp, and schnitzel being my favorites. Most recently, I was finally able to try the hanger steak since it was on special (not a regular menu item). It's melt in your mouth. It's served rare to medium rare, and the chef will not cook it beyond that temperature. Good for him.The real reason to go here is the Gorgonzola cream sauce. There aren't words for it. It's just that good. Of note, this isn't a place you go for ""sides."" They serve pasta and a veggie of the day. Sometimes you can get potatoes instead of pasta, but not on my most recent visit. It's good enough, but not mind blowing (IMO). But you're there for the Gorgonzola sauce anyway."
Osman’s Restaurant,4,"So enjoyable I shook the chef's hand! ...and his wife's hand also, who does the baking!Spur-of-the-moment 8pm dining accommodations for a birthday night out with my lady and her best friend greeted my evening well enjoyed at this hidden gem of Mobile, AL!Low-light, wood-floor, cozy ambiance...CHECK.Service excellence...CHECK.Wine selection...CHECK.On this first visit I went for full course meal. PLEASE SEE PICS. To start we order the Shrimp Gargonzola and the Escargo broiled in a garlic tarragon butter,. Both were superbly tender, seasoned appropriately and served traditionally.My lady guests shared the Catch Of The Day Chardonnay, a sauté fish with white wine, chicken stock, cream, lemon juice & capers.I opted for the lamb chops which were cooked to a perfect medium.All the sides were delicious!, Especially the pasta.For dessert we shared a slice of raspberry cheesecake (no creme brulee served here ) with a gentle South American Port Wine.I shall return to Osman's!"
Osman’s Restaurant,5,A great lil' gem in mobile. If you want to have an intimate gathering or impressive date night then I highly recommend this place. Great wine list...delicious German style food and attentive service!!
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"If you want good quality food without going downtown check this place out . It's an odd location not where you would think a restaurant would be, but it's 100 percent worth it . When you pull in it looks like a little house . Inside is charming and cozy . You do need reservations so call a few days before . I had the catch of the day Chardonnay. It was rainbow trout with a creamy wine lemon sauce . Very good ! I think I will try one the German schnitzel dishes they have next time . My friend had the veal piccata. She said she couldn't find a good place to get this dish anymore. It was the best she ever had . Don't skip dessert ! They are all homemade in house . We had a strawberry cream cake . It was a very light light cake  with strawberries and cream. So amazing and super light .I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu . I went with a friend but it's the perfect place for a night out with someone special ."
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"Everyone who lives in Mobile - or anywhere near Mobile - needs to go here at least once.  It is a small, classy restaurant with delicious food and a nice atmosphere.  I've been here half a dozen times, and I have loved it every time.  I always tell myself that I am going to try something new, but I honestly have gotten the jaeger schnitzel every. single. time.  It is a massive amount of food, and every bite of it is incredible.  I would highly recommend making a reservation if you are planning on going.  It is a small restaurant, which means that the staff can provide their undivided attention to each patron; however, this also means that it fills up quickly."
Osman’s Restaurant,5,Wonderful time.  Great place to have a long quiet dinner.  We shared a cheese board followed by mahi with white wine cream sauce and eggplant parmesan.  Cannot wait to return.
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"If you haven't dined here, you're missing out. A quaint gem with ALL the ambiance and flavor, so make sure to get your reservation in! The mussels are to die for. The seafood tortellini is amazing too. Oh...and if in doubt...top that steak with Gorgonzola sauce. You will not be disappointed."
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"A small restaurant inside an old house. Limited seating so I recommend making a reservation. House made salad dressing and an amazing cheese and herb spread for fresh, hot rolls. I ordered Gnocchi Gorgonzola with shrimp. This isn't offered on the menu so make sure to ask your server. One of the best meals I've had. Absolutely incredible."
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"This place is a true gem.  It's small, romantic and do make reservations.  The schnitzel is worth the trip alone and order gorgonzola or hunter sauce (or both) on the side.  Yum.  While prices are on higher side, you won't leave hungry as meal sizes are larger than most fancy places.  But more important than size is quality.  The food is simply delicious.  The location is a bit odd but parking is easy.  Other notable items my wife and I have tried are filet mignon, baked sea food tortellini, veal piccata,.. escargot, gorgonzola shrimp and baked brie appetizers.  Everything amazing.  Special occasion or not, this place is tops on my list."
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"After living in Mobile for almost 5 years my husband and I finally made it to the infamous Osman's. When folks suggest going there to eat they tell you how awesome the food is but they also remind you to not judge a book by its cover. I admit Osman's is located in a somewhat industrial area that has surely seen better days but like I was warned don't let the location deter you. The food and the service  is definitely the star, worry less about the location. Upon arrival we were seated promptly even though we were early for our reservation. Speaking of reservations definitely make one, the dining room is intimate (small) and if you don't make a reservation you're really chancing it. Mary was our server and was absolutely delightful she answered our questions, offered suggestions and paid close attention to detail. After sampling a few wines and Mary's suggestion we went with a bottle of Play Time. Shrimp Gorgonzola was our starter and that sauce OMG we were sopping it up with our bread. In addition to our starter we also  had salads accompanied by their house made dressings. My husband had the lamb chops with pasta and creamed spinach for his entree, again I say OMG. The lamb was cooked perfectly and the sides were huge and tasty (too much to eat at once). For my entree I had the baked tortellini that was piled high with seafood, sausage and enveloped in a delicious cream sauce. I DID NOT even attempt to eat my entree because we had so much food. Lastly for our dessert we had a berry cheesecake that was absolutely divine. I cannot say enough about this place everyone should go at least once."
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"To those who may not know, this is easily the most underrated restaurant in the city. Get the schnitzel (any of them). I do not like mushrooms, but was talked into the Jaegerschnitzel and didn't leave a single one behind. Bring your appetite because every entree is enough for 2+ meals. The location may be out of the way, but only because it would be impossible to get a reservation otherwise."
Osman’s Restaurant,5,"Ok So finally decided to go and see what's this Restaurant is all about.I was a bit surprised about the location it's something else. I have to be honest once you open the door you feel like you are at home. It's a great experience to walk into this place. I got so lucky because I venture to go in there without a reservation and luckily enough for me they had a spot for me so big win.Service to be honest it's magnificent my waitress was super knowledgeable and made some great suggestions.But of course the main reason we are all here: The food.Ok so I decided to start with the Mussels and I'll be honest it's been a long time that a plate blew me away like this, it was just delicious. The sauce the ingredients were in perfect harmony. Actually this plate made me give them 5 stars to be honest. Then I ordered for the main entree their lamp chops with the shrimp gorgonzola And here's what to me was the only flaw of the night. It came with a house salad. That in my honest opinion didn't have to be there it didn't look right it was just a waste. Still I had a bite just to try it. Then once the main dish arrived it looked so good and I can see why so many people swear by it. It looked good tasted even better and my only downside on it (The vegetables were over cooked) but overall it was the best meal I had here in Mobile hands down. I'm looking to go back and try something else of course this time I'll make a reservation. I'm a bit intrigued about their desserts and the cocktails since their bar also looked interesting and well stocked.Would totally recommend for a romantic dinner, trust me it's worth splurging a bit. And to the Chef and the staff keep doing what you do , you have something really special going on here. Bon appetit!"
Osman’s Restaurant,4,"I absolutely loved the ambience, the Gorgonzola shrimp appetizer, and the riojas wine! I also ordered the lamb, and it was very tasty. However the sides that came with it were not that great. My husband ordered the brown butter filet and that was delicious as well! It is a bit overpriced, but I would go back for a special occasion."
