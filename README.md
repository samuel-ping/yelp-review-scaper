# Yelp Review Scraper

## What I eventually want this to be:

This is intended to be part of my Food Mood project. I eventually want to make something (an API?) where you input the user's location and mood, and you get a list of restaurants curated to those inputs. I hope to use a machine learning model that can perform emotion analysis on a number of Yelp reviews from restaurants around the location input, and get the restaurants most tailored towards the mood input.

I created this repo as my first step, to create a dataset of Yelp Reviews by using Python and a webscraper (probably BeautifulSoup). I know there are already Yelp review datasets out there but I wanna at least try this first and see how it goes!
