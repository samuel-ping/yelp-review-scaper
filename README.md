# Yelp Review Scraper

## What this is

This is part of my Food Mood project. I eventually want to make something (an API?) where you put in the user's location and mood, and you get a list of restaurants curated to those inputs. I hope to use a machine learning model that can perform emotion analysis on a number of Yelp reviews from restaurants around the location input, and get the restaurants most tailored towards the mood input.

At the moment, this Python script scrapes Yelp reviews from restaurants all over the US, but the script appears to get stuck when Yelp throws a captcha at it :(
